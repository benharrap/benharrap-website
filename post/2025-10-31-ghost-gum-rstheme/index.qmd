So I took a picture more than a year ago. I took it because I liked the colour palette of these logs and thought it would make a nice RStudio theme. Well, over a year later, I finally got the zoomies and did what I'd intended and made the theme! I've called it Ghost Gum, although I don't think the logs are actually Ghost Gums. It's a cool name and a cool tree though. Enjoy!

You can find the theme along with my others on GitHub ([https://github.com/benharrap/rsthemes](https://github.com/benharrap/rsthemes)). If you want to have a go making your RStudio theme, check out the guide I made [here](https://benharrap.com/post/2024-04-12-custom-rstudio-themes/). I'd suggest using the Ghost Gum theme as the starting template though, I tried to streamline some of the options so you don't need to change the colour in so many locations.
