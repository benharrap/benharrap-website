abstract = {Child sexual abuse is a significant problem in many Indigenous communities; there is also evidence of chronic under-reporting of this crime. This study aimed to compare reporting rates between Indigenous and non-Indigenous cases of child sexual abuse across two Australian jurisdictions. Datasets comprising child sexual abuse reports from the Police Information Management Systems of the two jurisdictions were used to calculate reporting rates, and to compare case characteristics and case progression. Results indicated that the reporting rate for child sexual abuse of Indigenous children was between two and four times that of non-Indigenous children. In the Indigenous cases, the second jurisdiction had lower reporting rates than the first jurisdiction. Further analysis of the Indigenous cases only found that cases in the second jurisdiction were more severe, more likely to have a forensic interview, and more likely for the suspect to be charged, than in the first jurisdiction. However, there were no significant differences in conviction rates between the two jurisdictions. Differences observed in severity and case progression suggest that the lower reporting rates observed in the second jurisdiction may be due to comparatively high levels of under-reporting, rather than lower actual levels of child sexual abuse. In conclusion, reporting rates of child sexual abuse can be better understood when further information, such as case characteristics and case progression rates, is available.},

The purpose of the study is to develop a profile of infant children in OOHC and to better understand why so many young children require OOHC services and their experiences with the child welfare system. Using administrative data, we employ both descriptive and multivariate analysis to explore how child, child maltreatment history and system factors are related to the placement of infants in care. Our results are in line with research conducted in the USA and UK. The most notable finding is the high child protection reporting rate and high entry rate by infants and by Indigenous infants in particular. The tendency for infants to stay in care longer than other children, coupled with a high entry rate to care, has and will continue to have a significant impact on the child welfare system and its consequences. The implications for development of policy and early intervention programmes are discussed.}",

abstract = {Objectives
This study compared the profile of neglected and abused children in the Australian foster care system as well as differences between maltreatment types in relation to parental contact, reunification and psychosocial progress in care.
Method
The case files of 235 children entering foster care were examined and their social workers were administered standardised questionnaires at the point of intake. All measures were repeated for those remaining in care 1 year and then again 2 years later.
Results
Neglected children were younger than non-neglected children, more likely to have a physical or mental disability, more likely to experience multiple forms of maltreatment and less likely to pose conduct problems for carers. Neglected children were more likely than non-neglected children to experience a decline in parental contact over time, and were less likely to be reunified with their families of origin. There was minimal difference between neglected and non-neglected in their psychosocial progress while in care. Aboriginal children were more likely to be reunified than non-Aboriginal children when neglect was attributable to transient factors (parental incapacity) but the reverse was true for non-neglected children.
Conclusions
The fact that neglected children more often require a second form of maltreatment before being removed from home suggests that children's services workers are less inclined to remove children for neglect than for other forms of maltreatment. As a consequence, those neglected children who are in care tend to come from more dysfunctional families than non-neglected children do, as evidenced by the relatively poorer parental contact and reunification results of neglected children.
Practice implications
Neglected children differ systematically from non-neglected children and suffer relative disadvantage in relation to multiple forms of maltreatment, parental contact, and reunification. The fact that declines in parental contact among neglected children in care occurred only when indirect contact was provided suggests that, wherever possible, care plans should include face-to-face visits and overnight stays rather than being restricted to less direct forms of contact. The difference in the success of reunification according to type of neglect (chronic or transient) also suggests that parental intervention programs need to focus their efforts on chronic factors rather than transient parental factors.},

abstract = {This study of management information provides data on all reports, investigations and findings of maltreatment of children in Western Australia from their birth in 1990 or 1991 until their eighteenth birthday. It provides prevalence rates of children being reported, investigated and found to have been maltreated. A study of more recent cohorts shows trends in recent years. A key finding is that over 13 per cent of all children born in 1990 and 1991 were reported before reaching the age of eighteen, although 71 per cent of them were not found to have been maltreated. International data suggest this rate of one in eight children being reported may be equalled or exceeded in countries with an Anglo-American forensic child protection system. There was also a disturbing increase in reports of Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders in recent cohorts with an estimate that almost half of those born in 2004 had been reported before their fifth birthday. These findings add further evidence to the need for social work to address and severely limit investigative approaches. In this way, social workers will provide support rather than continuing practices involving high rates of surveillance and a focus on parental blame.},

Western Australia saw a large increase in the number of children in state care similar to trends across Australia as a whole. The study shows the following trends: changes in response to ‘referrals' with particular increases in the number of findings of neglect and increasing proportions of these followed swiftly by entry to care; changes in patterns of entry to care with more children under one-year-old entering; increased length of stay of children in care; and, the high incidence of Aboriginal children entering and remaining in care. The data demonstrate unequivocally that increased ‘referrals' are not associated with increased substantiations of harm or ‘acts of commission with dangerous intent', but that neglect assessed early in the lives of children was the major precipitant for entry to care and particularly so for Aboriginal infants.},

abstract = {Objective
Determine whether a history of family social disadvantage and/or child abuse and neglect explain the overrepresentation of Indigenous Australian young people in youth detention.
Methods
Maternal survey data from the Mater University Study of Pregnancy was linked with child abuse and neglect and youth justice data from the Queensland Department of Families, Youth and Community Care.
Results
Indigenous Australian children were 1.81 times more likely to be notified to child protection authorities for maltreatment and 1.77 times more likely to have that maltreatment substantiated. Indigenous Australian young people were 3.07 times more likely to have a youth justice history. When adjusted for social disadvantage, the odds of the Indigenous Australian youth having had involvement with the youth justice authorities remained 2.51 times that of their non-Indigenous peers. When adjusted for substantiated maltreatment, the odds of the Indigenous Australian youth having had involvement with the youth justice authorities remained 2.83 times that of their non-Indigenous peers. When adjusted for both social disadvantage and substantiated maltreatment, the odds of the Indigenous Australian youth having had involvement with the youth justice authorities remained 2.48 times that of their non-Indigenous peers.
Conclusions
The overrepresentation of Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander young people in the youth justice system, including Youth Detention, is only partly explained by their greater social disadvantage and by their greater experience of substantiated maltreatment, either separately or combined.},

Design, setting and subjects: A historical cohort study using administrative data collections of notifications and substantiated cases of maltreatment among children aged from 0 to 17 years. Main outcome measures: Annual rates of notification and substantiation of different types of child maltreatment. Results: From 1999 to 2010, the overall annual rates of notification for maltreatment of Aboriginal children showed an average increase of 21{\%} (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 1.21; 95{\%} CI, 1.19–1.24). The greatest increases were in notifications for neglect and emotional abuse. There were parallel increases in rates of substantiated cases of maltreatment. Among non-Aboriginal children, the overall annual rates of notification also increased (IRR, 1.10; 95{\%} CI, 1.07–1.14); however, changes in annual rates of substantiated cases for all types of maltreatment were not statistically significant. Conclusion: There have been considerable increases in both notifications and substantiated cases of child maltreatment, most prominently among Aboriginal children. It is possible that the observed increases reflect increasing incidence of maltreatment; however, they are also consistent with a mix of increased surveillance, improved service access, changes in policy and a shift in public attitudes.},

abstract = {Abstract Objective: To use hospital admissions data to investigate trends in maltreatment among Northern Territory Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal children. Design, setting and participants: A historical cohort study using diagnosis and external cause codes from hospital admissions among children aged 0–17 years. Main outcome measures: Annual rates of admission with either a definitive or indicative code for child maltreatment. Results: From 1 January 1999 to 31 December 2010, the average annual rates of hospital admission of NT Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal children with a definitive code of maltreatment were 8.8 (95{\%} CI, 7.4–10.2) and 0.91 (95{\%} CI, 0.59–1.22) per 10 000 children, respectively. There was no evidence for change over time in either population. The corresponding rates of admission with a code indicative of maltreatment were 28.4 (95{\%} CI, 25.8–31.1) and 5.2 (95{\%} CI, 4.4–6.0) per 10 000 children, with average annual increases of 3{\%} (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 1.03; 95{\%} CI, 1.00–1.07) and 4{\%} (IRR, 1.04; 95{\%} CI, 0.96–1.11). Physical abuse was the prominent type of maltreatment-related admission in both populations. There were increases in rates of admission for older Aboriginal children (13–17 years) and older non-Aboriginal boys. Most perpetrators in the assault of younger children were family members, while among older children most were not specified. Conclusion: Our study shows the utility of hospital admissions for population surveillance of child maltreatment. The relatively stable rate of maltreatment-related hospital admissions among NT Aboriginal children shown here is in contrast to substantial increases reported from child protection data. The results also highlight the overlap between violence within families and in the wider community, particularly for older children, and lends support for population-level interventions to protect vulnerable children.},

abstract = {The aim of the current research was to advance understanding of child protection in Australia by examining the factors associated with recurrence of child protection notifications to the formal child protection system. Extant research has been primarily undertaken in the USA and it is important to understand whether similar factors associated with recurrence actually hold in the Australian context. Administrative data were obtained for a sample of 9608 children first subject to a screened-in report in 2011–12. Children were followed for 12 months. Cox Proportional Hazard models were used to measure associations between 26 independent variables and four types of recurrence: subsequent reports, subsequent investigations, subsequent substantiations, and subsequent intervention. Factors associated with recurrence in Australia were broadly similar to those identified in other jurisdictions, including reports and substantiation for neglect, younger age, prior child protection involvement in the household, and parental characteristics including drug use, mental health problems, and history of maltreatment as a child. As in previous studies, post-investigative service provision was positively associated with recurrence. In prior US research, race did not predict recurrence. However, in the present study, Indigenous Australian children were significantly more likely to be subject to all types of recurrence measured. Future research on recurrence should aim to disentangle the complex relationships between child protection recurrence, child maltreatment, and service delivery. Recurrence is not a good proxy indicator of child safety. The findings have implications for the equity of recurrence-based risk assessment tools as they are applied to indigenous populations.},

In Australia, however, there have been few longitudinal studies that have examined these associations and relatively less is known in this area. This study examines the overlap between the child protection and youth justice involvement in South Australia, and determines how substantiated maltreatment and variations in these experiences (e.g., the type, timing and recurrence of maltreatment) relate to criminal convictions as a youth. The results show that although the majority of child-protection involved youth do not become convicted offenders, the odds of subsequent convictions are significantly greater both for those with notifications and substantiated maltreatment and for those who had been placed in out-of-home care. Multivariate analyses revealed that the strongest predictors for receiving a conviction among maltreated youth were: male gender, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander ethnicity, experiences of physical abuse and emotional abuse, a greater number of substantiations (recurrence), experiencing maltreatment that commenced in childhood and continued into adolescence, and placement in out-of-home care. The mechanisms through which maltreatment might be linked with behavior are then considered, along with directions for future research in this area.},

Of the 747 patients aged {\textless}10 years incurring 834 hospitalisations for the consequences of violence during the study period, 570 (76{\%}) were less than 4 years of age. A total of 43 deaths from violence were recorded and 74 (9{\%}) patients were admitted for more than one episode of violence. Victims aged 0–4 years from rural (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.72; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI] 1.35, 5.43) and remote parts (HR = 2.79; 95{\%} CI 1.25, 6.25) of the state were at increased risk of a subsequent admission for violence compared with those residing within the metropolitan area. Indigenous children aged 5–9 years were significantly more likely (HR = 3.57; 95{\%} CI 1.14, 11.13) to incur a second hospitalisation for violence than their non-Indigenous counterparts. The identification of young victim subgroups at high risk of repeat hospitalisations is important for developing intervention strategies to reduce the burden of interpersonal violence. Young children aged 0–4 years living in rural and remote locations and Indigenous children aged 5–9 years should be specifically targeted for attention.},

Higher rates of general admissions and admissions for injuries, infections, mental and behavioural disorders, and external causes of morbidity, were associated with a markedly increased risk of child maltreatment allegations and substantiation.Conclusions The hospital system plays not only an important role both in the surveillance of maltreatment-related injuries and conditions but also in the role of prevention in the referral of families who may need support and assistance in ensuring the health and safety of their children. This research highlights the importance of moving to electronic patient records in identifying children who have high rates of admissions and the types of conditions they have previously presented with, particularly for injuries, mental and behavioural disorders and external causes of admissions.},

abstract = {Background Previous research shows that maternal mental illness is an important risk factor for child maltreatment. This study aims to quantify the relationship between maternal mental health and risk of child maltreatment according to the different types of mental health diagnoses.Methods The study used a retrospective cohort of children born in Western Australia between 1990 and 2005, with deidentified linked data from routine health and child protection collections.Results Nearly 1 in 10 children (9.2{\%}) of mothers with a prior mental health contact had a maltreatment allegation. Alternatively, almost half the children with a maltreatment allegation had a mother with a mental health contact. After adjusting for other risk factors, a history of mental health contacts was associated with a more than doubled risk of allegations (HR=2.64, 95{\%} CI 2.50 to 2.80). Overall, all mental health diagnostic groups were associated with an increased risk of allegations. The greatest risk was found for maternal intellectual disability, followed by disorders of childhood and psychological development, personality disorders, substance-related disorders, and organic disorders. Maltreatment allegations were substantiated at a slightly higher rate than for the general population.Conclusions Our study shows that maternal mental health is an important factor in child protection involvement. The level of risk varies across diagnostic groups. It is important that mothers with mental health issues are offered appropriate support and services. Adult mental health services should also be aware and discuss the impact of maternal mental health on the family and children{\&}{\#}039;s safety and well-being.},

RESULTS: The birth prevalence of neonatal withdrawal syndrome increased from 0.97 to a high of 42.2 per 10 000 live births, plateauing after 2002. Mothers with a previous mental health admission, low skill level, Aboriginal status or who smoked during pregnancy were significantly more likely to have an infant with neonatal withdrawal syndrome. These infants were at greater risk for having a substantiated child maltreatment allegation and entering foster care. Increased risk for maltreatment was associated with mothers who were aged {\textless}30 years, were from socially disadvantaged backgrounds, Aboriginal status, and had a mental health-or assault-related admission. CONCLUSIONS: There has been a marked increase in neonatal withdrawal syndrome in the past 25 years. Specific maternal characteristics identified should facilitate planning for early identification and intervention for these women. Findings demonstrate an important pathway into child maltreatment and highlight the need for well-supported programs for women who use illicit drugs during pregnancy as well as the need for sustained long-term support after birth.},

METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of all children born in Western Australia during 1990-2005 using de-identified record linked child protection, disability services and health data. Cox regression was used for univariate and multivariate analysis to determine the risk of substantiated child maltreatment for a number of child and parental factors, including child disability, parental age, socio-economic status, parental mental health, substance use and assault-related hospital admissions. Separate analyses were conducted for Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal children. RESULTS: This study found a number of child and parental factors that increase the risk of substantiated child maltreatment. The strongest factors were child intellectual disability, parental socio-economic status, parental age and parental hospital admissions related to mental health, substance use and assault. CONCLUSIONS: Awareness of the factors that make children and families vulnerable may aid the targeting of child maltreatment prevention programmes. To prevent child abuse and neglect it is essential that we have a platform of universal services, which assist parents in their role, as well as targeted services for at-risk families.},

abstract = {Objectives
To investigate the prevalence, trends, and characteristics of maltreatment and assault related hospital admissions and deaths among children; and identify common injuries and conditions associated with these admissions using routinely collected morbidity and mortality data.
Methods
A retrospective cohort study of all children aged 0-17 years in Western Australia from 1980 to 2005 was identified from linked de-identified population level data. Annual trends in prevalence of assault and maltreatment related admissions were calculated and child characteristics were investigated using logistic regression models.
Results
Assault admissions more than doubled from 2.8 per 10,000 children in 1981 to 6.1 per 10,000 in 2005 (p{\textless}0.0001) and maltreatment admissions rose from 0.7 per 10,000 children in 1981 to 1.3 per 10,000 in 2005 (p{\textless}0.0001). Males aged greater than 12 years were at greater risk of an assault, while children aged less than 6 years were more likely to be at risk of maltreatment as well as those from greater disadvantaged backgrounds. Aboriginal children were more likely to be identified with assault and maltreatment compared to non-Aboriginal children. Common indicators of assault admissions included injuries of the skull and facial bones, intracranial, wrist, hand, and abdominal injuries. Children with maltreatment-related admissions were more likely to have superficial head or abdominal injuries and a high proportion had infectious and parasitic diseases, particularly intestinal infections. Many of these cases were associated with factors influencing health status, particularly socioeconomic and psychosocial circumstances.
Conclusions
There has been a steady increase in the prevalence of assault and maltreatment related admissions. Specific child characteristics and injuries associated with child assault and maltreatment-related admissions have been identified using routinely collected morbidity data and may be utilized as potential indicators for identifying and monitoring child abuse and neglect.
Practice implications
Broadening child maltreatment surveillance to children's admissions for assault and maltreatment is an important public health initiative which can be improved by the increased use of external cause codes. Health data is collected using international coding standards enhancing comparability across states and countries and has clinical implications in highlighting injuries associated with child abuse and neglect.},

This study will determine where disparities in child protection involvement exist among Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal children and characteristics associated with infant removals. Challenges faced by child protection and other agencies, and opportunities for overcoming these, are discussed. Methods Data from both the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare and linked Western Australian government data was used to examine disparities between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal children in the child protection and out-of-home care system. Results Nationally, Aboriginal children are ten times more likely to be placed in out-of-home care than non-Aboriginal children and this disparity starts in infancy. Infants were removed from parents with high levels of risk. Aboriginal infants were at increased risk of being removed from women with substance-use problems and had greater proportions removed from remote, disadvantaged communities than were non-Aboriginal infants. Conclusions Aboriginal infants have a high rate of removal. Although there are many complexities to be understood and challenges to overcome, there are also potential strategies. The disparity between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal infant removals needs to be seen as a priority requiring urgent action to prevent further intergenerational trauma.},

abstract = {Background
Previous research shows a co-occurrence between children's exposure to violence and child maltreatment.
Objective
This study examined the risk of maltreatment allegations in children whose mothers had been hospitalised due to an assault.
Participants and setting
The study used a retrospective cohort of children born in Western Australia between 1990–2009 (N = 524,534) using de-identified linked-administrative data.
Methods
Multivariate Cox regression determined the adjusted and unadjusted hazard ratios for child maltreatment allegation in children with a mother hospitalised for assault. Models were adjusted for a range of sociodemographic characteristics.
Results
One in five children had a maltreatment allegation following their mother's hospitalisation for assault. This increased to two in five children when the mother was assaulted in the prenatal period. Aboriginal children accounted for 57.6{\%} of all allegations despite representing only 7.8{\%} of the population. Children whose mother had a hospitalisation for assault were nine-times (HR = 9.20, 95{\%}CI: 8.98–9.43) more likely to have a subsequent maltreatment allegation than children whose mother did not have a hospitalisation for assault. Following adjustment for confounding factors, both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal children had an almost two-fold increased risk of maltreatment allegation (HR = 1.56, 95{\%}CI: 1.43–1.70; HR = 1.93 95{\%}CI:1.80–2.07).
Conclusions
Our study shows that child maltreatment allegation is common in children following a maternal hospitalisation for assault. Targeted early intervention is required for families with young children, and pregnant women experiencing violence. Importantly service staff need awareness of the impact of violence on families and the appropriate services to refer families to.},

abstract = {Abstract Background Children in out-of-home care have well-documented health and developmental needs. Research suggests that Aboriginal children in care have unmet health and intervention needs. In metropolitan Sydney, Kari Aboriginal Resources Inc. (KARI), an Aboriginal organization, provides support to indigenous children in care, including clinical assessment and intervention. We wanted to determine the health and developmental needs of a subset of children in out-of-home care with KARI, who had been in stable care for at least a year. We wanted to identify child, carer, and intervention characteristics that contributed to children doing well. We also wanted to identify enablers and barriers to providing culturally competent intervention. Methods We used mixed methods. From the KARI clinic database over the past 3 years, we identified children who had been in stable care with KARI for {\textgreater}12 months. We compared clinical measures and outcomes for these children with results from previous audits. We carried out a group discussion and key informant interviews with therapists and caseworkers to identify risk and resilience factors for each child, as well as enablers and barriers to culturally competent intervention. Results The health and developmental profile of the 26 children identified as being in stable care was similar to that of previous audits. Most (88{\%}) were getting speech pathology intervention; one third were getting occupational therapy and psychological intervention; most children and their carers attended cultural programmes. The majority of children (25/26) improved in their developmental health. Caseworkers and therapists identified risk and resilience factors related to child, carer, and home characteristics. They also identified elements of good practice; systemic issues prevented some interventions from being carried out. Conclusions There are challenges delivering a trauma-informed, culturally respectful service to Aboriginal children in out-of-home care in an urban setting, but it can be done if attention is paid to culture and the enablers and barriers are identified.},

abstract = {Background The Nurse Family Partnership Program developed in the USA, designed to improve mother and infant/child outcomes, has reported lower rates of child protection system involvement. The study tested the hypothesis that an adapted Nurse Family Partnership Program implemented in an Aboriginal community in Central Australia (the FPP) would improve Child Protection outcomes. Methods This was a retrospective and prospective cohort study drawing on linked administrative data, including birth registry, primary health care client information system, FPP program data, and child protection data. Participants were children of women eligible for the FPP program (an exposed and a control group of women, eligible but not referred) live-born between 1/3/2009 (program commencement) and 31/12/2015. Child protection data covered all reports, investigations, substantiations and out-of-home care placements from the time of the child's birth to 31/12/2016. Generalised linear modelling was used to estimate the relative risk (RR) of involvement with child protection and type of involvement (report, investigation, substantiation, out-of-home-care placement) among FPP and control children. Results FPP mothers (n = 291) were on average younger, were more likely to be first-time mothers and experiencing housing instability than control mothers (n = 563). Among younger mothers ≤20 years, FPP children had statistically significantly lower rates of involvement with child protection (ARRreport = 0.49, 95{\%} CI: 0.29 to 0.82; ARRinvestigation = 0.34, 95{\%} CI: 0.19 to 0.64; ARRsubstantiation = 0.45, 95{\%} CI: 0.21 to 0.96) and experience fewer days in care (ARR = 0.10, 95{\%} CI: 0.02 to 0.48). Among children of first-time mothers, FPP children also had statistically significantly lower rates of involvement with child protection (ARRreport = 0.50, 95{\%} CI: 0.30 to 0.83; ARRinvestigation = 0.36, 95{\%} CI: 0.19 to 0.67; ARRsubstantiation = 0.38, 95{\%} CI: 0.18 to 0.80) and fewer days in care (ARR = 0.06, 95{\%} CI: 0.01 to 0.27). Conclusion Study results suggest a modified Nurse Family Partnership delivered by an Indigenous community-controlled organisation may have reduced child protection system involvement in a highly vulnerable First Nations population, especially in younger or first-time mothers. Testing these results with an RCT design is desirable.},

abstract = {Background Child protection services exist to reduce potential harms from child maltreatment. Many jurisdictions produce annual data on child protection system (CPS) involvement, leaving a gap in knowledge of lifetime involvement. Objective To describe lifetime involvement in CPS, by type of contact. Participants All 608,547 children born in South Australia (SA), Australia between 1986 and 2017. Methods A retrospective cohort design using linked administrative data to report cumulative incidence of CPS involvement from birth to age {\textless}18 (or June30 2017) by Aboriginal status. CPS involvement was categorised into notifications (3 levels), investigations, substantiations and out-of-home care (OOHC). Cumulative incidence curves were derived for 5 birth cohorts. Results Across childhood (to age {\textless}18 years), substantiated maltreatment was experienced by 3.2–3.6{\%} of non-Aboriginal and 19–25{\%} of Aboriginal children, 7 times reported annual substantiation rates. For most CPS categories CPS involvement increased until 2010, and was occurring earlier in life. By age 3, 0.5{\%} of non-Aboriginal and 4.5{\%} of Aboriginal children born 1986–1991 were the subject of a substantiation compared with 1.9{\%} and 15{\%} of non-Aboriginal and Aboriginal children, respectively, born 2010–2017. Incidence rates beyond age 3 were similar. OOHC contact was similar across cohorts, with ˜1.5{\%} of non-Aboriginal and 12.7{\%} of Aboriginal children ever-placed in care. Conclusions Data linkage is an essential tool for understanding life course involvement with the CPS and describing trends not observable from annual snapshots. Such information is critical for burden of disease estimates, informing policy and monitoring CPS performance.},

In Australia, Aboriginal children have significantly worse health outcomes than non-Aboriginal children. We wanted to identify the health and well-being of Aboriginal children entering OOHC, placed with an Aboriginal organisation, who accessed a specialised multidisciplinary clinic in south-western Sydney. We wanted to identify children entering care who were doing well and who improved in care. We also wanted to identify enablers and barriers to care. Methods:  We analysed records of the first 100 children attending the OOHC clinic in south-western Sydney. Measures included clinical outcomes and recommendations at first and subsequent visits. Descriptive statistics were calculated using SPSS 16.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Key stakeholders from the relevant agencies were interviewed about enablers and barriers to care by independent evaluators. Results:  A significant proportion of children had health needs identified including speech delay (54\%), under-immunisation (50\%), behaviour problems (45\%), hearing problems (44\%), visual problems (35\%) and dental problems (36\%). Sixteen per cent of the children were doing well at first visit; a third improved in care, and a third remained stable. Significant differences were identified in health and educational needs between the under-5 year olds and the 5–13 year olds. Key barriers identified were systemic issues and lack of resources for intervention. Conclusions:  Children attending this clinic had similar rates of problems identified as other studies. School-age children appear to have significant additional health needs. Targeted developmentally and culturally appropriate interventions need to be provided to address the identified barriers to care.},

Australian Indigenous people have poorer health than non-Indigenous people, are less likely to utilise health services and more than twice as likely to be hospitalised (AIHW 2009). Little specific research attention has been given, however, to Indigenous children in hospital-based studies of Australian Indigenous peoples. Most studies focus either on the total Indigenous population, or compare Indigenous and non-Indigenous groups (Glasgow et al. 2003). Where studies including Indigenous children have occurred, they have examined outcomes in relation to vaccine-preventable conditions only (Burdon 1995) or explored experiences of remote Aboriginal families whose children were in an urban paediatric hospital (Tanner et al. 2005).

abstract = {Measures of the gap in living standards, life expectancy, education, health and employment between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians are primarily derived from administrative data sources. However, Indigenous identification in these data sources is affected by administrative practices, missing data, inconsistency, and error. As these factors have changed over time, assessing whether the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians has changed over time, based on data unadjusted for these sources of error can potentially lead to misguided conclusions. Combining administrative data on the same individuals collected from different sources provides a method by which a more consistent derived Indigenous status can be applied across all records for an individual within a linked data environment. We used the Western Australian Data Linkage system to produce derived Indigenous statuses for individuals using a range of algorithms. We found that these algorithms reduced the amount of missing data and improved within-individual consistency. Based on these findings, we recommend our Multi-Stage Median algorithm be used as the standard indicator of Indigenous status for any reporting based on administrative datasets when multiple datasets are available for linkage, and that algorithmic approaches also be considered for improving the quality of other demographic variables from administrative data sources.},

abstract = {Aim Children in statutory out-of-home care (OOHC) are known to have poorer physical, developmental and mental health outcomes compared with their peers. The number of children in OOHC is increasing in Australia, with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children disproportionately represented. To document the health needs of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children and adolescents in OOHC attending the paediatric service at the Victorian Aboriginal Health Service (VAHS) between February 2014 and February 2016. Methods The electronic medical records of all patients in OOHC seen by a paediatrician at VAHS between February 2014 and February 2016 were audited. Demographic data, including age and type of OOHC placement, were recorded, as were their health needs. Results Of the 200 children seen by a paediatrician over this 2-year period, 103 were identified as being in OOHC for all or some of this same period: 43 in foster care, 8 in residential care and 52 in kinship care. Of the 103 children, 35 were <6 years of age, 51 between 6 and 13 years and 17 between 13 and 18 years; 66\% were identified as having mental health problems, 37\% hearing problems, 34\% vision problems, 40\% dental caries and 46\% developmental delay including 36\% with speech delay. Conclusions Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children in OOHC seen by the paediatric service at VAHS have high rates of physical, developmental and psychological health needs. These data have significant potential to inform government policy and investment in effective models of care to better meet the needs of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children in OOHC.},
