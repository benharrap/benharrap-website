<p>Sometimes you see a picture and think to yourself “oh I like the colour composition here”. Well when I think that, I also think “this would make a great RStudio theme”. So I’ve created two more RStudio themes!</p>
<p>I’ve renamed my original <code>noodle</code> repository, where I kept the first theme I created, to <code>rsthemes</code> since it made sense to keep all of the themes I’ve made together. You can find it here: <a href="https://github.com/benharrap/rsthemes">https://github.com/benharrap/rsthemes</a></p>
<div id="knitted" class="section level2">
<h2>Knitted</h2>
<p>The knitted theme came from a jumper that I got for my kid. My partner and I were at a market for locally made goods and came across this stand where a nanna was selling little knitted jumpers that she made. It was the <em>coolest</em> jumper I’d ever seen and I wish she made them in adult sizes too. There’s no point trying to describe it, just take a look:</p>

<p>I love the bright colours in the jumper and the pale colours looked like they’d work as a background, so I turned it into an RStudio theme. I’m pretty happy with the results:</p>

<h2>Corymbia</h2>
<p>I was out for a walk in Canberra’s botanic gardens and walked past this beautiful plant, later identified by my dad as <em>corymbia ficifolia</em>. It’s an Australian native with gorgeous blooms. While I’d already walked past it I thought it was such a lovely colour scheme that I went back to snap a picture. Here’s what I took:</p>
<div class="float">

<p>And here’s what the theme ended up like:</p>
