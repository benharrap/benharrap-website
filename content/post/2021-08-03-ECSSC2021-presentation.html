<p>I presented this talk at the Early Career and Student Statistician’s Conference in 2021. I found that while I learned a lot at university about statistics and data, I didn’t learn a great deal about what it’s like practising statistics in an applied setting. So I made this talk, where I talk about all the things I learned in the first few years of working after graduating from university.</p>
