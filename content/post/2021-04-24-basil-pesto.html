<p>This basil pesto recipe is the result of me making pesto innumerable times and tweaking it each time until I got it just right. My goal was to make a pesto that tastes just like the one you can buy from the Queen Victoria Markets in Melbourne. I think I got pretty close, but you be the judge!</p>
<div id="ingredients" class="section level2">
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<p><img src="/img/basil-pesto/ingredients.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>3 bunches of basil</li>
<li>150ml extra-virgin olive oil</li>
<li>60g parmesan</li>
<li>60g pine nuts</li>
<li>2 cloves of garlic</li>
<li>3 tablespoons of lemon juice</li>
<li>2 pinches of sea salt flakes</li>
<li>10 turns of a pepper mill</li>
</ul>
<p>You will also need a food processor to combine the ingredients together, unless you fancy doing it all by hand.</p>

<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>Begin by attaching both the blade and fine-grating attachment to the food processor.</p>

<p>Grate the parmesan using the processor.</p>

<p>Remove the grating attachment and add all of the remaining ingredients. When you add the basil the food processor should be at least two-thirds full - three bunches usually works for me, but if you have a stingy supplier of basil you might need a fourth.</p>

<p>Process until smooth. You might need to scrape down the sides of the food processor a couple of times, I find the basil leaves like to stick to the side.</p>

<p>That’s it! Your pesto is now ready. If you end up making this let me know what you think on <a href="https://twitter.com/BHarrap" target="_blank">Twitter</a>.</p>
<p>You can store it in a jar in the fridge but I find it doesn’t keep longer than a week, even with putting an oil seal on the top. What I do, and I’m very sorry if this upsets any nonnas, is divide the pesto into a large ice-cube tray and freeze it. When you need some pesto just microwave a cube in a bowl for 30 seconds or so to defrost.</p>
