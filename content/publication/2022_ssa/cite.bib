  abstract={The Statistical Society of Australiaâ€™s (SSA) Equity Diversity and Inclusivity (EDI) Comittee conducted a survey on EDI issues as they related to the SSA, seeking responses from both members and non-members to open and closed questions. Sixty-four responses were received over a one-and-a-half month period. Eighty-seven percent of respondents were current members and 56% did not consider themselves as coming from an under-represented background. The majority of respondents, regardless of background, considered the SSA to be an inclusive and welcoming organisation, however for those from an under-represented background only half always felt welcome at SSA-run events. Responses to the open-ended questions generated discussion among the EDI Committee and broader Executive Committee, which has resulted in the work being done to address how the SSA recruits members to join its councils, what topics the SSA should make public statements on, and making information on the organisational structure of the SSA more easily accessible to new members.}
