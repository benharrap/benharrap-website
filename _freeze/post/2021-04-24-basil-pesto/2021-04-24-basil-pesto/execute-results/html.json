My goal was to make a pesto that tastes just like the one you can buy from the Queen Victoria Markets in Melbourne. I think I got pretty close, but you be the judge!\n\n## Ingredients\n\n![](/img/basil-pesto/ingredients.png)\n\n- 3 bunches of basil\n- 150ml extra-virgin olive oil\n- 60g parmesan\n- 60g pine nuts\n- 2 cloves of garlic\n- 3 tablespoons of lemon juice\n- 2 pinches of sea salt flakes\n- 10 turns of a pepper mill\n\nYou will also need a food processor to combine the ingredients together, unless you fancy doing it all by hand.\n\n## Instructions\n\nBegin by attaching both the blade and fine-grating attachment to the food processor.\n\n![](/img/basil-pesto/food-processor.png)\n\nGrate the parmesan using the processor.\n\n![](/img/basil-pesto/grated-parmesan.png)\n\nRemove the grating attachment and add all of the remaining ingredients. When you add the basil the food processor should be at least two-thirds full - three bunches usually works for me, but if you have a stingy supplier of basil you might need a fourth.\n\n![](/img/basil-pesto/ingredients-in-processor.png)\n\nProcess until smooth. You might need to scrape down the sides of the food processor a couple of times, I find the basil leaves like to stick to the side.\n\n![](/img/basil-pesto/pesto-after.png)\n\nThat's it! Your pesto is now ready. If you end up making this let me know what you think on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/BHarrap){target=\"_blank\"}.\n\nYou can store it in a jar in the fridge but I find it doesn't keep longer than a week, even with putting an oil seal on the top. What I do, and I'm very sorry if this upsets any nonnas, is divide the pesto into a large ice-cube tray and freeze it. When you need some pesto just microwave a cube in a bowl for 30 seconds or so to defrost.\n\n![](/img/basil-pesto/pesto-cubes.png)",
