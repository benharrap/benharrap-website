Rates of contact with CPS have been occurring at younger ages for children born more recently\n2. Contacts are clustered within sibling groups and risk carries over to siblings born later\n3. Prevalence of mental and neurodevelopmental health ~3x higher for children in OOHC compared to children never removed\n4. Prevalence of neurodevelopmental health conditions ~2x higher for children removed before the age of one than children first removed after the age of one\n5. Rates of PPHs are higher for ever-placed children across all ages\n6. Rates remain higher compared to never-placed children, even after CPS intervention\n7. Placement in care has largest impact on PPHs in first few years of life\n\n## Child protection implications\n\n- Parents with children removed need more support\n  - We know they are at increased risk of future children being removed\n  - Reunification and prevention of future removals\n- Support needs to be culturally safe\n- Input from Aboriginal people and Elders important in decision making process\n  - Staff within child protection system\n  - Aboriginal family-led decision making\n  - Assigning child protection responsibilities to Aboriginal agencies\n\n## Health implications\n\nChildren with experience of out-of-home care often have multiple, complex health needs\n\n- Public health system capacity is an issue (for everyone)\n  - Availability of affordable general practice\n  - Lengthy wait times for specialist care\n  - Increase in culturally competent medical professionals\n- Reducing risk of PPHs\n  - Improvements in housing\n  - Access and availability of healthcare\n    - Transport\n    - Wait times\n    - Cost\n\n## What this contributes\n\n- Addresses research gap\n  - \"We already knew this\"\n  - Quantifies some intersections of child protection and health\n- Prioritising Aboriginal voices in the research process\n- Laying groundwork for future research\n  - Disaggregation by region\n  - Building on DAG, include broader datasets\n  - Estimating effects of policy changes\n  - Measuring informal care\n\n## Research translation activities\n\n- Translational workshops with community, government stakeholders, peak bodies\n- Presentations to staff at NSW and WA child protection offices\n- Presentation at International Population Data Linkage Conference 2022\n- Infographics and lay summaries\n- Open-access publications\n\n# Acknowledgements\n\n## Data custodians\n\nI wish to thank the staff at DLSWA and the custodians of the Birth registrations,  Midwives Notification System, Death registrations, Child Protection and Family Support Data, Hospital Morbidity Database Collection, Emergency Department Database Collection, WA Register of Developmental Anomalies - Birth defects, WA Register of Developmental Anomalies - Cerebral Palsy, Intellectual Disability Exploring Answers, Mental Health Information System. \n\nThe information presented does not reflect the views of the Data Linkage Branch or any of the data custodians.\n\n## Thanks\n\n- Supervisory team\n- PhD cohort\n- Family and friends\n- Community reference group\n\n# References\n\n::: {#refs}\n:::","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\nI presented my PhD completion seminar to the Melbourne School of Population and Global Health on the 10th of May, 2024.

Rates of contact with CPS have been occurring at younger ages for children born more recently\n2. Contacts are clustered within sibling groups and risk carries over to siblings born later\n3. Prevalence of mental and neurodevelopmental health ~3x higher for children in OOHC compared to children never removed\n4. Prevalence of neurodevelopmental health conditions ~2x higher for children removed before the age of one than children first removed after the age of one\n5. Rates of PPHs are higher for ever-placed children across all ages\n6. Rates remain higher compared to never-placed children, even after CPS intervention\n7. Placement in care has largest impact on PPHs in first few years of life\n\n## Child protection implications\n\n- Parents with children removed need more support\n  - We know they are at increased risk of future children being removed\n  - Reunification and prevention of future removals\n- Support needs to be culturally safe\n- Input from Aboriginal people and Elders important in decision making process\n  - Staff within child protection system\n  - Aboriginal family-led decision making\n  - Assigning child protection responsibilities to Aboriginal agencies\n\n## Health implications\n\nChildren with experience of out-of-home care often have multiple, complex health needs\n\n- Public health system capacity is an issue (for everyone)\n  - Availability of affordable general practice\n  - Lengthy wait times for specialist care\n  - Increase in culturally competent medical professionals\n- Reducing risk of PPHs\n  - Improvements in housing\n  - Access and availability of healthcare\n    - Transport\n    - Wait times\n    - Cost\n\n## What this contributes\n\n- Addresses research gap\n  - \"We already knew this\"\n  - Quantifies some intersections of child protection and health\n- Prioritising Aboriginal voices in the research process\n- Laying groundwork for future research\n  - Disaggregation by region\n  - Building on DAG, include broader datasets\n  - Estimating effects of policy changes\n  - Measuring informal care\n\n## Research translation activities\n\n- Translational workshops with community, government stakeholders, peak bodies\n- Presentations to staff at NSW and WA child protection offices\n- Presentation at International Population Data Linkage Conference 2022\n- Infographics and lay summaries\n- Open-access publications\n\n# Acknowledgements\n\n## Data custodians\n\nI wish to thank the staff at DLSWA and the custodians of the Birth registrations,  Midwives Notification System, Death registrations, Child
