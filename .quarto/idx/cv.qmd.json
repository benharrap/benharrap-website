Using this pipeline, I also report on question performance and missingness to inform our questionnaire redesign process.\n\nI also provide my expertise to multiple other studies and research groups, as well as supervise graduate students and conduct survey methodology research of my own. In my first few months I also took the lead on finishing the study’s operational manual. In doing this, I converted the existing Word draft into a HTML document using Quarto, making the manual more user-friendly, improving the interface, and making the maintenance of documentation easier.\n\n### Quantitative Social Scientist, Research Fellow\n\n-   Centre for Indigenous Policy Research, Australian National University\n    -   October 2023 – October 2024\n\nIn my short time at CIPR I worked on two major reports. For the first, I examined social and emotional wellbeing for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children and youth in the Longitudinal Study of Indigenous Children (LSIC). Starting with an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander theory of social and emotional wellbeing, I used exploratory factor analysis and structural equation modelling to map data items in LSIC to different domains of social and emotional wellbeing.\n\nThe second was a technical report commissioned by the Productivity Commission and Coalition of Peaks, where my co-authors and I proposed a more statistically rigorous method for measuring progress toward Closing the Gap targets. The report covered improvements in measuring progress, recommendations for increasing the quality, frequency, and relevance of data collected for these measures, and guidelines on how to communicate probabilistic statements from statistical models in easy to understand ways.\n\n### PhD Candidate\n\n-   Indigenous Health and Epidemiology Group, University of Melbourne\n    -   March 2020 – June 2024\n\nThroughout my PhD I translated findings from Aboriginal-led qualitative research and community reference group conversations into questions I could address using linked administrative datasets. This included how contacts by child protective services are clustered within sibling groups, the prevalence and cumulative incidence of mental and neurodevelopmental health conditions, and estimating the effect of placement in out-of-home care on rates of potentially preventable hospitalisations. \n\nI used a variety of statistical methods, including descriptive statistics, various regression models, survival analysis, and matching methods. All of my research was written in R and RMarkdown, where I created a reproducible pipeline from data cleaning through to multiple journal articles and my final thesis.\n\n### Biostatistician\n\n-   Deakin University\n    -   August 2022 – October 2023\n-   Grampians Health\n    - September 2021 – October 2023\n\nIn these two biostatistician roles I acted as the sole statistical expert in clinical research and academic settings. Across these roles I provided study design and statistical oversight for a randomised trials, including sample size calculations, developing statistical analysis plans and randomisation schemes, advising on technical challenges arising, and analysing trial data. I also developed educational materials and delivered seminars for clinicians on the topic of good research practices.\n\n<!-- ### Research assistant -->\n\n<!-- -   Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, University of Melbourne -->\n<!--     -   September 2019 – January 2023 -->\n\n<!-- As part of the International and Immigrant Health Group I provided data and statistical support to the research team.
