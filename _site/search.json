    "text": "Employment\n\nBiostatistician, Data Manager, Research Fellow\n\nYardhura Walani, Australian National University\n\nOctober 2024 – Present\n\n\nMy time is spent mostly on the Mayi Kuwayu Study, The National Study of Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Wellbeing. The first thing I did was take the lead on finishing the study’s operational manual. In doing this, I converted the existing Word draft into a HTML document using Quarto, making the manual more user-friendly, improving the interface, and making the maintenance of documentation easier.\nI’m also working on building a data cleaning and management pipeline in R, using targets to manage the structure and evaluation of the pipeline, renv to manage package dependencies across user systems, integrating external data sources via various APIs, and having the different stages of data cleaning and management feed into a user manual, data dictionary, and survey data quality report, all using R and Quarto to automate the majority of their generation.\n\n\nQuantitative Social Scientist, Research Fellow\n\nCentre for Indigenous Policy Research, Australian National University\n\nOctober 2023 – October 2024\n\n\nIn my short time at CIPR I worked on two major reports. For the first, I examined social and emotional wellbeing for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children and youth in the Longitudinal Study of Indigenous Children (LSIC). This was done by starting with an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander theory of social and emotional wellbeing and using exploratory factor analysis and structural equation modelling to map data items in LSIC to different domains of social and emotional wellbeing.\nThe second was a technical report commissioned by the Productivity Commission and Coalition of Peaks, where my co-authors and I proposed a more statistically rigorous method for measuring progress toward Closing the Gap targets. The report covered improvements in measuring progress, recommendations for increasing the quality, frequency, and relevance of data collected for these measures, and guidelines on how to communicate probabilistic statements from statistical models in easy to understand ways.\n\n\nPhD Candidate\n\nIndigenous Health and Epidemiology Group, University of Melbourne\n\nMarch 2020 – June 2024\n\n\nThroughout my PhD I translated findings from Aboriginal-led qualitative research and community reference group conversations into questions I could address using linked administrative datasets. This included how contacts by child protective services are clustered within sibling groups, the prevalence and cumulative incidence of mental and neurodevelopmental health conditions, and estimating the effect of placement in out-of-home care on rates of potentially preventable hospitalisations.\nI used a variety of statistical methods, including descriptive statistics, various regression models, survival analysis, and matching methods. All of my research was written in R and RMarkdown, where I created a reproducible pipeline from data cleaning through to multiple journal articles and my final thesis.\n\n\nBiostatistician\n\nDeakin University\n\nAugust 2022 – October 2023\n\nGrampians Health\n\nSeptember 2021 – October 2023\n\n\nIn these two biostatistician roles I acted as the sole statistical expert in clinical research and academic settings. Across these roles I provided study design and statistical oversight for a randomised trials, including sample size calculations, developing statistical analysis plans and randomisation schemes, advising on technical challenges arising, and analysing trial data. I also developed educational materials and delivered seminars for clinicians on the topic of good research practices.\n\n\nResearch assistant\n\nPeter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, University of Melbourne\n\nSeptember 2019 – January 2023\n\n\nAs part of the International and Immigrant Health Group I provided data and statistical support to the research team. Major achievements included the development of a REDCap database and provision of on-site research training for local staff for an evaluation of a dietary and lifestyle intervention in a remote Aboriginal community in the Northern Territory, and a systematic review of type 2 diabetes in resettled refugee and asylum seeker populations.\n\nCentre for Health Policy, University of Melbourne\n\nApril 2018 – January 2022\n\n\nI supported Emeritus Professor Lesleyanne Hawthorne in the examination of skilled migration to Australia. My work revolved around sourcing data, understanding its complexities, and summarising it to capture quantitative trends in skilled migration to Australia. ABS data products, including the census, were used, as well as administrative data from the Department of Home Affairs, the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency, and the Occupational English Test. We also collaborated with Canadian colleagues to produce a comparison between Australia and Canada’s migration programmes.\n\nMelbourne Institute, University of Melbourne\n\nMay 2019 – February 2020\n\n\nIn this short-term role I prepared the final wave of the Medicine in Australia: Balancing Employment and Life survey for release. This involved data cleaning, consistency checking, and updating the user manual to reflect changes to the survey, a process which was technical and required great attention to detail. I was also the data custodian, managing the secure transfer of data for research purposes. This role was challenging as I inherited a great deal of code with minimal documentation, however I spent the time to understand how it worked, added the necessary updates, and wrote my own documentation for future reference."

It’s a testament to the passion and interest that you all have in learning and improving your practice. So given your busy when we work together I’ll do my best to work around your schedule and capacity.\nWhen we are working together, you bring your clinical expertise and content knowledge to the table along with a question you think is important. I bring my statistical and methodological expertise that can help answer your question and my main goal is to help you do the best research that you can.\nNow because I don’t have your clinical background, when we’re working together I’m going to have to ask you a lot of questions at the beginning to make sure I understand what the clinical context is. This is really important for me to be able to guide us towards a study design or analysis method that’s going to help answer the question that you have.\nI’m not trying to make your life difficult by asking you 20 questions, I promise. I do want to note though that in the process of asking you 20 questions it’s not unlikely that your original question will change slightly, perhaps due to some constraint of available data or the number of people that’s feasible to recruit into your study, or some other reason. Don’t be disheartened when this happens, it’s a good thing - we’re refining your research question into something workable!"

Having been in this situation a number of times I can tell you that it’s really challenging to be able to help. More often than not it turns out that I can’t answer the research question with the data that’s been gathered, and this is frustrating for everyone involved. So please try to involve a statistician earlier on.\nIf you come to me early on in the planning phase we can work together to create a comprehensive methods section of the protocol and set your study up for success.

Different studies require different levels of involvement. I already know that you’re incredibly busy outside of trying to do research, so thinking about how much time you have available is important. I wouldn’t suggest committing to a randomised controlled trial if you or your colleagues haven’t got the time to drive it. Not everything needs to be a randomised controlled trial\nCross-sectional studies are relatively easy, there’s no follow up, no risk of people dropping out. However you can’t determine cause and effect. Useful for hypothesis generation, can be done using medical records (e.g. taking a cross-section of patients who attended your clinic during 2020). So if we were to think of the pedometer study as a cross section, we might just take a cross section of pregnant women and ask them if they have a pedometer or not and measure their weight.\nSelecting people based on their outcome status and obtain information on any exposures retrospectively. Can be done using medical records, but deciding on an appropriate ‘control’ group can be challenging. To fit the pedometer study into this framework we’d have to first define what “excessive gestational weight gain” is, then we could use medical records from a group of women visiting the maternity unit and somehow figure out if they had a pedometer\nIdentification of a cohort of people without your outcome of interest at some baseline and following them up over time. Tend to be harder to run, suffer from people dropping out of the study\nFor a prospective cohort, perhaps we ask women whether they have a pedometer on their first visit to the maternity unit then we keep track of their weight over the course of their visits to the unit.\nRandomised studies:\nPeople with characteristics or health conditions of interest are recruited into a study and randomly allocated to one or more groups, then followed up over time to see what their outcomes are. These studies also tend to be costly and harder to run but are important for estimating cause and effect of treatments.\nSo for the pedometer study again, we could recruit pregnant women who visit the maternity unit and randomise them to one of our treatment groups, keeping track of their activity and weight over the course of their pregnancy, then analyse the results at the conclusion of the study.\nSometimes not always feasible to run a randomised trial though - e.g. we wouldn’t want to randomise someone to an exposure group where we force them to smoke cigarettes to examine lung cancer rates.\nNon-randomised studies:\nAn example of a non-randomised study design is a ‘before and after’ study, where we might only use one intervention and take a measurement of our outcome of interest before and after our the intervention is administered. In this example there is no randomisation and we assume any changes in our outcome are due to the implementation of the intervention."

If the question can’t be answered by the available data we’ll need to change the question or the data source.\nWho is extracting the data? Is it just you? Are multiple people extracting data? We need to make sure everyone is on the same page about what data we need so we end up with consistent and usable data\nIs measurement consistent across time? One of the challenges of using existing data, especially administrative and routinely collected data, is that if an operational change occurs that affects the way data is collected and we don’t know about it we can end up drawing spurious conclusions based on artefacts of the data.\nAre we using a previously validated measure? Are we designing from scratch? Do we need to pilot the measure? Is the measure appropriate for the population we’re interested in? What are the range of values we expect to measure? Do the instruments capture this range?\nThis is especially important if we’re getting people to fill in the information themselves. If the question is confusing or vague, we’ll end up with a variety of data in formats we weren’t expecting or cannot use. This could be as simple as telling people what date format to use when writing the date."

Temperature in celsius\n\nRatio - Like interval data except there is a meaningful zero\n\nE.g. Age or blood pressure or drug dosage\n\n\nFor nominal data there isn’t any ordering, they’re just different categories. There isn’t any order to blood types.\nFor Likert scales, this means scales like “Strongly disagree, disagree, neutral, agree, strongly agree”. In this example there’s a clear ordering going from the strongest level of disagreement through to the strongest level of agreement. Strongly disagree isn’t ‘twice as disagreeable’ just disagree, but there’s an order to options such that we could rank them in some way.\nThe point about no meaningful zero is important - for example with temperature the difference between 10 and 20 degrees celsius is the same as 20 and 30 degrees celsius - it’s a difference of 10 units in both cases. However, we wouldn’t say that 20 degrees is twice as hot as 10 degrees.\nThinking about the previous example where we couldn’t make statements about something being twice as much, for ratio data we can make those statements. For example, someone age 40 is twice the age of someone aged 20. The zero is also meaningful here as it indicates a complete absence - for example a drug dose of zero means no drug."

In the case of ice cream sales and violent crime, when sales go up so does violent crime - they are positively correlated.\nHowever, just because the two are correlated, it doesn’t mean that one causes the other. Increasing ice cream sales does not cause violent crime and conversely increasing violent crime does not cause ice cream sales to go up.\nThere’s a third common factor here - the temperature. As summer comes along and the temperature goes up, so do ice cream sales (who doesn’t like an ice cream on a hot day). Violent crime also goes up during summer - maybe because people are hot and bothered, maybe because people spend more time outdoors so there are more opportunities for violent crime to occur, who knows.\nThe point here is that just because you find that two things are correlated with each other, it doesn’t mean that there’s a causal relationship between them."

    "text": "The title says it all really. RMarkdown, along with bookdown, has made my life so much easier when it comes to writing up papers and reports. If you’re a non-R user I hope this blog post convinces you to ditch other word processing software and make the jump to RMarkdown. It’s free!\nThis post was borne out of a tweet about using RMarkdown that seemed to be well received, and someone asked if there was a tutorial. There probably is already, but I figured I would write my own mini-guide on the things I do that make writing so much easier in RMarkdown. This isn’t going to be comprehensive but hopefully it gives you enough of an idea that if you run into trouble you can google your way out of it.\nBefore we get into why writing reports using RMarkdown is a no-brainer I want to preface that I am absolutely not an expert in R or RMarkdown and it’s quite possible there are smarter/cleaner/more efficient ways of doing everything here. What I will show you though is all the things that I think are really swell.\nI write all my documents and knit to PDF, so all my advice is based around this setup. No idea if it works the same if you knit to other formats. Also, there is some degree of assumed knowledge in this post, for example you know what it means to knit a document or what a code chunk is. If you’re unsure about what something means you can google it - this is how I learned most of my knowledge. If you are really stuck you can always send me a tweet. I can’t promise I can help but it’s possible.\nOne final caveat - I’m a Windows user. All this stuff is probably functionally the same on Mac but I couldn’t tell you so you might need to translate my Windows instructions into Mac. If you’re a linux user… Well you probably know how to do all of this anyway, or at the very least you’re a sucker for software punishment so will have no qualms googling your own problems.\nOk, time to get into the good stuff."

    "text": "Stuff that made my life easier\n\nFolder structure\nThis section isn’t required by the way, but starting out with a coherent and organised folder structure is nice. My brief stint in web development taught me a lot about directory structure, which is why I do things this way. It might not be super necessary but having a consistent way of organising things makes it easier to find what you’re looking for when you come back to a project after a year. There are plenty of resources out there on good folder structures, so I won’t spend too long here. Below is a toy example of what a nicely organised project folder might look like:\n2022-02-10-chapter-3\n- code\n    analysis.R\n    cleaning.R\n- data\n  - raw-data\n      original_data.csv\n  clean-data.csv\n- img\n    histogram.pdf\n    survival-curve.pdf\n- meetings\n    2022-02-10.txt\n- tab\n    summary-stats.csv\n    interactions.csv\nchapter-3.Rproj\ncitation.csl\nreferences.bib\nwriteup.Rmd\nwriteup.pdf\nI have separate folders for my code, data, images, meeting notes, and tables. Then in the main directory I have the R project file, my references, and my RMarkdown file with the write up in it. I do often end up with other random files in the folder that I don’t have a home for and that’s fine, but at least most things have a home. This is what works for me, if it doesn’t work for you, you do you.\nI always start each project by making a new folder where I’m planning to keep everything and name it using the convention “yyyy-mm-dd-project-name”. The date being the date on which I created the folder, and doing so means alphanumerically sorting the folders also sorts them chronologically. Nice!\n\n\nWorkflow\nThis section is where the basis for the magic begins. Getting this right is critical to automating the numbers, tables, and figures in your write up.\nI try my best to split my code up into different .R files depending on what I’m doing, with each subsequent file starting off with the data produced at the end of the previous file. This means if you need to edit something during the cleaning phase you can do so, and as long as you haven’t done anything drastic, your changes shouldn’t break anything downstream. The order I tend to follow in my code is:\n\nGetting the data together\n\nFor my thesis I work with multiple linked datasets, each contained in their own .csv file. For an analysis I might need to use information from births data, deaths data, and child protection data. So the first thing I do is get all my data together. This usually just means running a bunch of read_csv() commands to get all the datasets in that I need.\n\nCleaning the data\n\nNext I look through each dataset and make sure it contains what I think it should, doesn’t contain any nonsensical values (e.g. negative ages), and fix any errors that I come across. For me, cleaning the data means only working with the existing variables and values in the dataset, distinct from making new variables which I do in the next section.\n\nPreparing the data\n\nI suppose ‘preparing’ the data is just another type of cleaning, but I like to call them different things because it helps separate out the two processes. By preparing data I mean creating new variables or datasets based on the result of the cleaning stage. This could be performing a bunch of joins, reshaping your data from wide to long, making composite variables. The goal of this section is to end up with the variables and datasets that you need for your analysis.\n\nAnalysing the data\n\nThis is arguably the exciting section, where you get to fit your models, plot your graphs, create your summary tables. Anything that you plan to include in the write up of your analysis should be saved as a distinct file. This means any tables or figures should be saved in the folders you made for them (see @Folder Structure). By doing this you don’t have to re-run the entirety of your code when you come back to work on your write up.\n\nWriting up\n\nIdeally all your analysis is done and all you need to do is write up the results. Assuming each of the previous stages has gone well, the tips in the next few sections should make writing up a little less painful.\n\n\nEasy citations\nHave you been terrorized by EndNote? Is Mendeley telling you the MS Word addin is not installed even though you’ve installed it three times? Has Zotero … well I don’t know anything about Zotero but every software has its bugs. Anyway, ditch the citation management software, we’re doing hipster references now. (Note: you don’t have to ditch your reference management software, see my final comment in this section)\nThe end goal of using RMarkdown (or is it bookdown? I don’t know) for citations is to reduce the burden of keeping track of your in-text references, adding them to the bibliography, and getting the formatting of your references correct. All you need to do is keep your references file up to date.\nSo to start, you need to make a references file. If you currently have all your references in one of the aforementioned software then you will need to export it to a .bib file. Some of them already store references in this file format anyway so it’s no trouble, others you will need to figure out how to export as a .bib. One way or another you need to have a .bib file. Fortunately, if you’re not sure how to export your existing references list google will have the answer.\nIf you’re starting from scratch, open up your project folder, right-click and make a new text file. Edit the name and call it references.bib, making sure to delete the .txt so it’s called references.bib not references.bib.txt. If you can’t delete the .txt extension you might need to change your explorer settings to allow you to do so.\nOk so you have your shiny new references.bib. Now we need to add citations to it. Every journal’s website has some way of exporting citations as a .bib. Some journals make it way too complicated for my liking, but it is possible. When you’re on the page of the article that you want to cite, find the ‘Cite this’ button and click ‘Export as .bib’ or whatever sounds like it’ll give you a .bib file. It could also say ‘export as BibTeX’, since .bib is the file extension for BibTeX files. This is what it looks like on Elsevier’s website:\n\nIf it’s not possible, you can always go to Google Scholar, search for the article, and get the citation that way. I usually do this if I forgot to download the citation at the same time as I downloaded the article or if it’s a report or something from ‘grey literature’. The latter reason makes Google Scholar quite handy as it saves you from having to manually create the citation. Below is what you need to click on in Google Scholar to get a BibTeX citation.\n\nOnce you have your citation the next step is to put it in your references.bib file. All you need to do is copy and paste it from the file you just downloaded (or directly from the browser if you used Google Scholar). I like to use Notepad to open my references file because I’m a reference hipster but you can open it in RStudio too. I should probably do this but Notepad does the job and I like it. You can paste the citation anywhere in your references file as long as it’s not inside of another citation. RMarkdown will let you know if there’s a problem with your references file anyway, so if you make a boo-boo you’ll hear about it. I did try to keep my references file in alphabetical order by first author’s last name, but it got out of hand pretty quickly and now it’s a jumbled mess. Fortunately CTRL + F exists so who cares. Here’s a snippet from my references.bib for my PhD thesis.\n\nNext we have an example of a citation, the very first publication I was an author on.\n@article{eaton2019,\n  title={Incidence of treated first episode psychosis from an Australian early intervention service and its association with neighbourhood characteristics},\n  author={Eaton, Scott and Harrap, Benjamin and Downey, Linglee and Thien, Kristen and Bowtell, Meghan and Bardell-Williams, Melissa and Ratheesh, Aswin and McGorry, Patrick and O'Donoghue, Brian},\n  journal={Schizophrenia Research},\n  volume={209},\n  pages={206--211},\n  year={2019},\n  publisher={Elsevier}\n}\nNote at the beginning of the citation immediately after the opening bracket { it says eaton2019. This string is what you will use when citing that article in the text of your RMarkdown document. Pick a convention for this string and stick to it so you don’t need to keep looking through your reference file to find the name you gave to the citation. My preference is first author’s last name and year of publication. If they have multiple publications in a year I just put a/b/c at the end of each publication to distinguish them as you can’t have two citations with the same name.\nWith your references.bib filled in and ready to go, now you need to make your citations in text. Every citation begins with the @ symbol followed by the string for the article you want to cite. In the above example recall it was eaton2019 so in our RMarkdown text we would type something like @eaton2019 found... or greater incidence of first episode psychosis [@eaton2019]. Note the use of square brackets in the second example.\n@eaton2019 found... becomes “Eaton et al. (2019) found…”\nwhereas\ngreater incidence of first episode psychosis [@eaton2019] becomes “greater incidence of first episode psychosis (Eaton et al. 2019)”\nNow you know how to add citations to your references file, add everything you read in there. It doesn’t matter if it’s full of unused citations, only the ones you cite in text will appear in your references list.\nThere are two final pieces to this puzzle. The first is the citation format. Depending on the requirements of the journal you’re submitting to, or professor you’re writing an assignment for, download the appropriate csl file for the citation format. You can find an enormous list of csl files on Zotero’s website, which is where the bookdown authors suggest you look.\nThe beauty of being able to switch your citation style by changing one line of code brings a tear to my eye. If only I knew about this in my undergraduate degree, I wouldn’t have missed those couple of marks for correct formatting. You do need to tell RMarkdown to use the csl file though, so in the header of your document you need to include the following code\nbibliography: \"references.bib\"\ncsl: \"harvard-the-university-of-melbourne.csl\"\nThe second piece is to tell RMarkdown where you want your reference list to go. Just place the following bit of code where you want your references to go and it’ll get populated when you knit the document.\n&lt;div id=\"refs\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\nThat’s it!\nOne final comment here is that you can stick with your existing reference management software - as long as you’re able to define the citation string (that first bit of text in the BibTeX reference) and export your reference list to a .bib file. If you can’t manually define that string you’ll find the default is something absolutely bonkers you’ll never remember, like S0022283665802716.\nI prefer to manually manage my references because ultimately it doesn’t matter how it’s ordered. I just stick every citation for everything I read into my references.bib file and when it comes to writing up, everything I’ve read is ready to be cited.\n\n\nAutomatic numbering for tables and figures\nPicture this - you’ve finished your first draft and there’s a smattering of tables and figures. For each table and figure you manually wrote out its number based on where it appears in the article and each of them is referred to multiple times throughout the text. Your collaborator gives you feedback that Figure 3 should come earlier in the article, Table 5 is unnecessary, and maybe Figure 4 should go in the appendix. Great! But now you have to go back and change their numbers and make sure your in-text references match these new numbers.\nThis is a horrible job and very much error-prone. We’re human after all. Fortunately bookdown can take care of the numbering for you.\nThe first thing you need to do is set the output in the header to pdf_document2. If you are knitting to a regular pdf the automatic numbering doesn’t work. You should have something like this in the header:\noutput:   \n  bookdown::pdf_document2\nNext, you need to give a name to each code chunk that you want to include in your text. For consistency you could name all the code chunks in your document but I only bother if it’s a table or figure I’m including in the text. In the below example I have a couple of summary tables from my beer spreadsheet. Notice in the code chunks below I have called the two tables rating and prior, which is what we’ll use for our referencing.\n{r rating}\nkable(rating, caption = \"Average cost and rating by style\")\n\n\n\nAverage cost and rating beer by style\n\n\nStyle\nPrice\nRating\n\n\n\n\nWild Ale\n5.50\n3.0\n\n\nDouble Neipa\n9.00\n2.0\n\n\nAmerican Ipa\n10.00\n2.0\n\n\nBrown Ale\n13.44\n3.3\n\n\nBelgian Tripel\n5.00\n1.0\n\n\n\n\n\n{r prior}\nkable(prior, caption = \"Average rating by number of beers consumed prior\")\n\n\n\nAverage rating by number of beers consumed prior\n\n\nBeers\nRating\n\n\n\n\n0\n2.6\n\n\n1\n2.7\n\n\n2\n2.5\n\n\n3\n2.5\n\n\n4+\n2.4\n\n\n\n\n\nHopefully you noticed these tables were already assigned numbers - the rating by style is Table 1 and the rating by number of beers prior is Table 2. I didn’t assign these numbers, they were automatically assigned for me. So how do we automate the in-text numbers? You simply use the code @\\ref(tab:&lt;your chunk name here&gt;), replacing the angle brackets with the name of your chunk that has the table in it. So if I were to reference the two tables above I’d use Table @\\ref(tab:rating) and Table @\\ref(tab:prior). Note that you still need to write out ‘Table’ beforehand, the reference only grabs the number.\nThe above method for tables is basically the same for figures too, you instead use @\\ref(fig:&lt;your chunk name here&gt;) - note ‘fig’ has replaced ‘tab’ in the round brackets.\nOne nuance I found is that the name of your code chunk is important. For example I called a chunk interactions_all and the auto-numbering did not work, it instead spat out @\\ref(fig:interactions_all) in the text. I renamed the chunk to all and updated the reference accordingly and it worked fine. Maybe it was an issue with the length of the name, maybe it was the underscore. I’m sure if I read the bookdown manual I’d understand why but who has time to read the manual, right!?\n\n\nAutomatic in-text numbers\nTyping in the numbers from your analysis is error prone - we’ve already established that we’re all human. Also, it’s a massive pain in the ass if you need to update everything because of changes to your code. Maybe your cohort is smaller now so all of your descriptive statistics changed, but instead of putting them in a table (like the previous section), you typed them into the body of your article. Well, RMarkdown allows you to do in-text R code too, as we’ll demonstrate.\nstats &lt;- beer %&gt;% \n  summarise(litres = round(sum(Ml)/1000),\n            minabv = min(Abv),\n            maxabv = max(Abv))\nIn the code above we made a few summary statistics and saved them in a dataframe called stats. If we want to insert them into the text, we just need to write some inline R code. For example, over the course of my beer recording adventures I consumed 131 litres of beer, with the least alcoholic beer coming in at 0.4% and the most alcoholic at 13%. The inline code I included for these three statistics were\n` r stats$litres`\n` r stats$minabv`\n` r stats$maxabv`\nFor the latter two, I included the percentage symbol immediately after the closing backtick to have it attached to the number. Also, in the three examples note the space between the first backtick and the ‘r’. This shouldn’t be there - I just had to include the space otherwise the code gets evaluated and you would see the numbers instead of the code."

    "text": "Minor gripes\nOk so BIIIIIIIIIG preface here that it’s highly likely that the stuff in this section is actually doable in R, it’s just these annoyances are so minor that I don’t mind my current way of overcoming them. For example, I use MS Word to get a word count but I just googled to see if you can get a word count in R and it turns out there’s a package called wordcountaddin. Not sure if I’ll use this package but it illustrates my point. I can’t think of a time I’ve not been able to find a package that does the thing that I need.\n\nSpell checking\nThe spell check function in RStudio is handy for picking up some spelling errors (duh) but there’s no checking for grammar, so my current method of doing a grammar check is to open the knitted PDF using MS Word. Just open up Word, click File -&gt; Open, then open the PDF and Word will do its best to translate the file into a Word document. Usually this works fine and often picks up an issue here or there that needs fixing. Note this isn’t a substitution for actual proof-reading - still do this! Apologies to non-Word users, not sure how you would do it without Word but I’m sure there’s a way.\n\n\nWord count\nWhen I’ve got the document open in Word I also do the word count. Criteria for word counts vary from journal to journal, with some including tables, some excluding, references do or don’t count. Anyway, I just delete all the non-contributing content and get my word count that way. Not the most efficient approach but it’s not painful and it works.\n\n\nFiguring stuff out is hard\nSometimes things break, or I can’t get them the way I want them to work, and it takes me ages to figure stuff out. Initially I would cringe at the thought of it taking me days to figure out how to make a table using R, when I could just make it in two minutes in MS Word. However I have spend countless hours over the past few years updating the same table over and over again due to changes in the data. Taking two days to learn how to make those tables in R would have saved me many more days of work in the long run. Having drunk the kool-aid I am now delighted that it took me three hours to figure out how to add an extra row to a table header.\nThe point I want to make is that if you are reading this blog post and trying to follow along and things don’t make sense or don’t work, don’t worry. You’ll figure it out eventually, this is just the process of learning something that is actually quite challenging to pick up."

    "text": "It’s been quite a few months since I started thinking deeply about my own gender identity and not a week has gone by where I haven’t found myself pondering on it.\nRecently I started reading bell hooks’ “The Will to Change” and the first chapter has been eye-opening. I see the phrase “I feel seen” jokingly thrown around a lot, but having heard the first chapter I genuinely do feel seen. The discussion of patriarchy and patriarchal masculinity spoke to me so deeply. Her discussion of the socialisation of patriarchal masculinity, how from birth we are socialised - overtly and covertly - on what behaviours are ‘right’ and ‘wrong’ for boys, cut deep. It brought up such an incredibly vivid memory for me, of being in my early teens, maybe year 8 or 9 at school, and making the decision that I wasn’t going to cry any more. I’d always been a sensitive child and crying felt like a somewhat regular occurrence. At some point though I internalised the idea that boys don’t cry, so when I did cry there was this additional distress of violating this gender norm. Ultimately I decided that crying was not a thing for me any more. And I didn’t, I suppressed the urge and found myself less connected to my own emotions. That’s not to say I didn’t cry once in the last ~20 years, but the action indeed is a rarity and I find myself suppressing the urge to cry even today. It’s become such a default response, to suppress tears, that I often don’t realise I’m doing it.\nAnyway, the point about crying was just one thing out of many in the book that I really connected with. The notion though, that alternative forms of masculinity exist, has been a great thinking point for me. Annoyingly, it’s one of those bits of knowledge that when you hear for the first time you go “OF COURSE! HOW DID I NOT THINK OF THIS BEFORE!”, but I’m not going to beat myself up for not questioning decades of socialisation. Considering this new knowledge then, the next question is…"

    "text": "Am I actually non-binary/agender?\nOr was this the only logical option at the time given I don’t relate at all to patriarchal imaginings of masculinity? As I said in the last post about gender identity, I was non-binary for the time being. Maybe I still am? I’m questioning whether I want a gender at all, or if gender is just a construct which we use to understand ourselves and relate to other people. For the time being, separating myself from what I originally understood masculinity to be is helping me to reflect on what else masculinity could be, at which point I’ll hopefully have a better understanding of whether I do indeed consider myself to be male, or just accept the masculine parts of myself as an agender person.\nPart of the struggle I have is that I feel like I have a poor imagination for what alternative masculinities could look like, that I want someone to give me a handbook of masculinities for me to pick from. This feeling is an odd one because I’ve always wanted to reject categorising people into boxes, so this desire to place my gender identity into a box is uncharacteristic. Does this feeling come from a desire to ‘fit in’ to a box? Is it just laziness and wanting to be told who I am instead of engaging in serious introspective thought? I’m not sure, but I definitely do need to engage in further introspection.\nAt the moment I’m seeking out more writing on the concept of masculinity, so if you have any suggestions on texts you think might be relevant please send me a link on Twitter. I’m currently reading work by Karla Elliott and Sam de Boise and Jeff Hearn, so I’ll see where this literature takes me."

    "text": "What makes a bad naming convention?\nLet’s start out with what makes for a bad naming convention. If we figure out what we don’t like, we can start to figure out what we do.\n\nNot using a convention\nMaking variable names up as you go along is clearly a bad idea. It creates much more work as you’ll have to either remember every specific variable name or look at the data dictionary every time. Planning variable names ahead of time is also important, if you make up a few names then try and fit new names into the pattern you’ve just made up, you’ll quickly run into issues where the names don’t work. So at the very least we need a naming convention.\nFor our general health question, maybe we called it generalhealth. Not terrible, but this isn’t going to be adequate in the context of an entire survey, as hopefully you’ll come to realise.\n\n\nPrioritising brevity\nMaking variable names as short as possible will save a few keystrokes at the cost of constantly referring back to the data dictionary to make sure you’re using the right one.\nWe could call the general health question genh or gh or ghr (general health rating). Yes, they’re short, but see how I had to explain what ghr stood for? It’s not immediately clear.\nAlso, text-completion exists in many IDEs, so don’t prioritise brevity!\n\n\nPrioritising interpretability\nConversely, prioritising interpretability can lead to excessively long variable names, which is at the other extreme!\nwave_1_health_general_health_general_health_rating_ordinal encodes lots of information - the wave, the section, the sub-section, some of the question wording, and the type of data. This kind of length might work for your own solo projects but not for a dataset that’s going to be used by lots of people.\n\n\nNames that are easy to mix up\nThis is more common with conventions that prioritise brevity, as they tend to use abbreviations and avoid delimiters, which makes variables difficult for our brains to process quickly and accurately. Imagine the convention {wave}{respondent}{topic}{2-letter ID} resulted in the variables bcgenmo and bcgemno. They’re from entirely different topics, gen and gem, but it is very easy to mix them up visually and through typos.\n\n\nUsing more than one case\ncamelCase, snake_case, kebab-case, SCREAMING-KEBAB-CASE, they’re all candidates but switching between cases is a no-no for variable names. It might be useful in other situations where you use one case for functions, another for variable names. But we’re just talking about variable names here, so don’t use more than one case.\n\n\nUsing more than one language\nThis was a good point from my BlueSky post (thanks Russell!). In my context in Australia, I’d use English, and only English, to name the variables in my dataset.\nPeople are going to have an easier time if we call the general health question general_health instead of allgemeine_gesundheit. If you were collecting data in Germany, allgemeine_gesundheit might make more sense.\n\n\nUsing letters for wave number\nOk this is probably a controversial one because I see it done time and time again. Yes, it’s a concise and convenient way of representing a number. However, it only works up to 26 waves (our survey’s going to run forever, right!?). It’s also a pain trying to remember which letter is which number and it forces you to write extra code to translate letters into numbers (e.g. match(\"k\",letters[1:26])).\nImagine we’ve got 20 waves of survey data, what wave is the general health question hhlthgenord in? I’m sat here counting out letters on my fingers because I don’t know off the top of my head.\nAlso, it can lead to odd variable names - some examples from the wild include:\n\nasdtype - Wave 1 survey type, not type of autism spectrum disorder\newluge - A question about geriatric care in wave 5, not a disdain for sleds\n\nThese are fairly innocuous examples but I’ve seen some inappropriately named variables too.\n\n\nUsing elements of the questionnaire design\nYou might be tempted to incorporate the question number into the variable name. Don’t.\nImagine the general health question is number 50 in wave 1, so we call it a50genh. In preparation for wave 2 we examine individual question response rates - looks like rates of missing data increase with increasing question number. We could address that in wave 2 by randomising the order of sections or putting the general health question earlier in the questionnaire. Good ideas, but either of these choices break the naming convention.\nThe same goes for using the section. The general health question might’ve been the only health question in the first wave, so it went in the ‘about you’ section and was called aaboutgenh. For wave 2 though we got funding from the Department of Health and they want to add a section on health. Now the general health question has moved to the ‘health’ section. Calling it bhealthgenh is encoding the section in wave 2 but is inconsistent with the wave 1 name. Calling it baboutgenh encodes the incorrect section in the name. Not good!"

    "text": "What makes a good naming convention?\nWe have an idea of what makes a bad convention, so what makes a good one?\n\nClearly defined components\nNaming conventions are built on components, with their combination resulting in variable names. Components you might use include:\n\nSurvey wave\nData type\nRespondent category\nQuestion theme\nQuestion keyword\n\nOnce you’ve identified the important components, next decide on how they will be combined - and stick to this formula!\nApplying the convention {wave}_{theme}_{keyword} to the general health question in wave 1 could lead to the variable name w01_health_general.\n\n\nConsidered ordering of components\nThe ordering of components should have a logic or hierarchy to it. I’d recommend following a hierarchy of information scope.\nFor example, the hierarchy in {wave}_{theme}_{keyword} goes from broad to narrow - {wave} relates to the whole survey and is the broadest in scope, {theme} relates to the theme or concept the question is getting at, but isn’t necessarily restricted to that question alone, and {keyword} has the most narrow scope, drawing on the specific wording of a question.\nAlso, think about how you might be working with the variables - R’s dplyr provides functions like ends_with() and starts_with() for a reason. From the palmer penguins dataset, consider the variables bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm, and flipper_length_mm. If we wanted to work with measurements relating to bills, these variables are readily identifiable (starts_with(\"bill_\")). Similarly, if we wanted to change millimetres to centimetres, we can identify these variables using ends_with(\"_mm\").\nThis also makes it easy to see sets of related variables in the data dictionary and produces sensible options in auto-complete lists. Contrast these two approaches (I made up a few extra variables):\n\n\nbill_length_mm\nbill_depth_mm\nbill_width_mm\nbill_colour\nbill_density\n\nlength_bill_mm\ndepth_bill_mm\nwidth_bill_mm\ncolour_bill\ndensity_bill\n\n\nHaving bill as the first component ({bodypart}?) makes it easy to spot variables relating to bills. Having {measurement} as the first component is more visually cluttered and in a dictionary of hundreds of variables would be harder to spot. You should consider the focus of the data though, maybe measurements are the focus in which case it would be more useful to have measurement as the first component.\n\n\nConsistent length of components\nThis consideration might not be relevant if you only have a small number of variables, but once you start hitting a large enough number that your data dictionary requires you to scroll up and down to see everything, it becomes useful to require each component to be the same length. Compare the following variable names following {topic}_{element}_{measurement}:\n\n\nNo restriction on component length:\npenguin_species\nlocation_island\npenguin_bill_length\npenguin_bill_depth\npenguin_bill_width\npenguin_bill_colour\npenguin_bill_density\npenguin_bill_mass\npenguin_flipper_length\npenguin_flipper_depth\npenguin_flipper_width\npenguin_flipper_density\npenguin_flipper_colour\npenguin_flipper_mass\npenguin_sex\nstudy_year\n\n4 characters, 3 characters, 4 characters:\npeng_spe\nloca_isl\npeng_bil_leng\npeng_bil_dept\npeng_bil_widt\npeng_bil_colo\npeng_bil_dens\npeng_bil_mass\npeng_fli_leng\npeng_fli_dept\npeng_fli_widt\npeng_fli_dens\npeng_fli_colo\npeng_fli_mass\npeng_sex\nstud_yea\n\n\nIgnoring whether the abbreviations are good or not (I just cut them off), I find having the variable names the same length means I’m having to do less visual processing when looking at them (I’m not distracted by the varying length) and can focus more easily on finding the variable I’m looking for.\nYou might find yourself in a circumstance where a component is optional, such as in the above example - the bill and flipper both have measurements like length and depth, which are encoded in the second component, but this component is only included where there are multiple measurements of the same thing. Ideally all components are required, however if you are going to use an optional component restrict the convention to one optional component and stick it at the end of the variable name. This prevents the absence of the component from impacting on how the variables look in a list:\n\n\nOptional {measure} 4 characters, {topic} 4 characters, {element} 3 characters:\npeng_spe\nloca_isl\nleng_peng_bil\ndept_peng_bil\nwidt_peng_bil\ncolo_peng_bil\ndens_peng_bil\nmass_peng_bil\nleng_peng_fli\ndept_peng_fli\nwidt_peng_fli\ndens_peng_fli\ncolo_peng_fli\nmass_peng_fli\npeng_sex\nstud_yea\n\n{topic} 4 characters, {element} 3 characters, optional {measure} 4 characters:\npeng_spe\nloca_isl\npeng_bil_leng\npeng_bil_dept\npeng_bil_widt\npeng_bil_colo\npeng_bil_dens\npeng_bil_mass\npeng_fli_leng\npeng_fli_dept\npeng_fli_widt\npeng_fli_dens\npeng_fli_colo\npeng_fli_mass\npeng_sex\nstud_yea\n\n\n\n\nChoose components that are resilient to changes in survey design\nWe know that questionnaire section is a poor component because it breaks as soon as questions are moved between sections. Instead, try and choose components that are unlikely to change over time. For example, the general health question asks about health so we could say its theme or focus is health. In our previous example then, {wave}_{theme}_{keyword} is not going to break when the question moved from ‘about you’ to ‘health’, but {wave}_{section}_{keyword} will.\nA side effect of choosing components that are resilient to changes in survey design is that if a circumstance arises that looks to break a variable name, it could be indicating that you need a new question instead.\n\n\nBalancing brevity and interpretability\nThe goal is to create variable names that are succinct.\n\nsuccinct, adjective. marked by compact precise expression without wasted words\n\nThis is as much of an art as a science, don’t be surprised if it’s difficult!\nTake the previous example wave_1_health_general_health_general_health_rating_ordinal. The section and sub-sections are redundant, repeating the words health and general. We could instead switch these components for the theme, which is still health, and get to wave_1_health_general_rating_ordinal. wave_1 could then be shortened to w01, and we could provide a schema for data type abbreviations:\n\nstr = strings\ncat = categorical\nord = ordinal\nnum = numeric\n\nSo we switch from {wave_#}_{section}_{subsection}_{keywords}_{type} to {wave}_{theme}_{keyword}_{type} and end up with w01_health_general_ord.\nOn abbreviations, I would suggest using them sparingly, rather than not at all. Sometimes there’s an important bit of information you want to encode in a variable or set of variables, but you can’t do it without using an abbreviation.\n\n\nConsider software requirements\nRelated to brevity, it’s important to think about your end-users and the software they use. Stata, SPSS, and SAS only support variable names up to 32 characters in length, meaning that is the hard maximum for your variable names. Variable names shouldn’t start with numbers either, hence why my examples for {wave} have been w01 not 01.\nIn coming up with my proposed convention, I kept in mind that people use datasets in long and wide format. I was debating whether to include wave as a component, w01_health_general, or to store it as a separate variable. Moving wave to be a variable instead of a component didn’t mean I now had an extra four characters (w01_) to work with though - if Stata users reshape the dataset into wide format using wave, they’ll run into problems with variable names that are 29 characters or more.\nWhile this might seem like over-engineering, it was a legitimate requirement of the end-users.\n\n\nConsider survey requirements\nAspects of the survey can also inform the components you choose, and also how you define those components.\nI’ve used w01 as an example of how wave could be encoded in the variable name. The reason for w01 and not w1 is that this allows for more than 10 waves to be encoded in a way that can be sorted:\n\nsort(c(\"w1\",\"w2\",\"w3\",\"w10\",\"w11\",\"w12\"))\n\n[1] \"w1\"  \"w10\" \"w11\" \"w12\" \"w2\"  \"w3\" \n\nsort(c(\"w01\",\"w02\",\"w03\",\"w10\",\"w11\",\"w12\"))\n\n[1] \"w01\" \"w02\" \"w03\" \"w10\" \"w11\" \"w12\"\n\n\nThe Longitudinal Study of Indigenous Children gathers responses from children, their parents, their teacher or carer, and their school principal. Respondent is included as a component in their variable names:\n\na = parent 1\nb = parent 2\nc = study child\nd = teacher/carer\ne = principal\n\nThe use of single letters here is prioritising brevity over interpretability, but you can see how this element of the survey informed the naming convention.\n\n\nUse a delimiter, consistently\nUsing a delimiter to separate the components of your variable names makes them much easier for humans to read, just make sure you pick one and stick with it. Which delimiter do you prefer:\nbill_length_mm\n\nbill.length.mm\n\nbill-length-mm\nI prefer underscores, I think they’re the easiest to read. But you also need to consider your end-user’s software. Programs like Stata don’t support dashes or dots in variable names, so you’re kinda forced into using underscores anyway. Fine by me!\n\n\nHave a human create and review the names\nThe convention you choose might act as a guide or it might act as a rule. If it’s a guide, there’s going to be some discretion involved in choosing what to use for certain elements, like {keyword}. For the general health rating, both w01_health_general and w01_health_rating are suitable options, but you have to choose one.\nRegardless of whether the convention is applied as a guide or rule, make sure you have a human review the resulting list of variable names, it’s important that you don’t end up with names that are offensive."

    "text": "Day 1\nWhat a day! I’m sitting back in my room with a thoroughly sunburned neck and a head full of ideas. It’s been fascinating coming to a conference that’s heavily focused on teaching. I have no background in teaching (besides learning vicariously through my partner’s teaching degree), so it was great to listen in on the conversations people were having about teaching. The language they use was quite different to what I’d hear on a day to day basis - I heard pedagogy several times.\n\nThe day started out with a Welcome to Country from local Elders, followed by Professor Chris Matthews and a panel of speakers talking about Garma Mathematics and two-way learning - meaning to teach in a way that incorporates both Western and Indigenous ways of knowing and being and treats them as equal. Then Yingiya Mark Guyala MLA told us part of his story, going from living on his homeland and getting a practical education from his Elders, through going to school and learning English, to getting his pilot’s license. He talked about how learning the balanda (the Yolgnu word for Western people) way was pulling him in one direction, and learning the Yolgnu way pulling him in the opposite, to the point where he couldn’t keep going. His story really drove home the importance of figuring out how to bring Western and Indigenous teaching together.\n\nIn the push against the deficit narrative that so often accompanies how Indigenous people’s lives are talked about, a strengths-based approach that sees Indigenous cultures and communities as a strength is something I often come across. And while this approach is something I agree with and try to incorporate into my own writing, I feel like I’ve only known it at a factual/intellectual level. Today really changed that for me though. I heard so many stories about the brilliance of Indigenous children, how they engaged and learned about mathematical topics typically considered ‘beyond’ the usual capabilities for their age, and this was all possible through their culture. The ‘complex’ mathematics were part of their lives, part of their culture, it just took making the connection between what they already knew and the specific mathematics.\nWe finished off the day with food, chatting, checking out the art gallery, and hanging out with the camp dogs."

    "text": "Day 2\nIn one of the sessions I had my first experience with a virtual reality (VR) headset, boy are they COOL. The workshop was a demonstration of a rapid design challenge the presenters run with children. We had to design come up with our own design of a fish net or trap, similar to those made by Indigenous cultures across Australia. Our group decided to make a crocodile catcher, and after a brief few minutes sketching some 2D designs on paper we were thrust into three dimensions via the VR headset.\n\nI also listened to a couple of presentations how culture can be woven into specific high school educational settings. The theme of yesterday came through again, that Indigenous culture(s) are such a source of strength and engagement in the classroom, even for non-Indigenous kids. We later heard from a group of teachers from the East Arnhem region who talked about the importance of teaching in language (Yolngu for the kids here). For the majority of the children, Yolngu matha is their first language, English is something they learned later. So while it might seem obvious to teach children in the language they know best, apparently it wasn’t obvious to everyone. But after teaching mathematics in their language and linking mathematical concepts to cultural ideas they were familiar with, the kids were more engaged and learned mathematical concepts more readily. One of the quotes that stuck with me too was that “Yolngu parents want their children to succeed, but not at the expense of their culture”, this point once again reaffirming the importance of incorporating Indigenous culture in teaching Indigenous children.\nThe talks finished at 3pm today and we went on a cultural walk through a trail down to a nearby beach. Some of the local kids and rangers explained various plants and their uses as we walked the trail. After passing an unusually angular arrangement of branches, we made it down to a secluded beach with beautiful views across the ocean.\n\nThe conference dinner was the final event of the evening, we shared food and conversation and were entertained by the Andrew Gurruwiwi band. If you haven’t listened to the band before, I highly recommend you check them out!"

We got together in groups of approximately ten to have a yarn about the topics we’d heard at the conference and what we were going to do going forward. It was such a brilliant way to round out a conference. In previous conferences I’ve been to you go to the talks you’re interested in but you effectively miss out on the other sessions you don’t attend. While there might be conference abstracts, you’re left to read them in your own time and reach out to the authors if you want more detail.\nBy getting everyone together and encouraging them to form groups with people they might not have met or know well, we all got to learn more deeply about the conversations had throughout the conference. Then at the end, each group got up and gave a summary of their yarn so everyone could learn. It was such a beautiful way to make sure that nobody missed out on the learnings made at the conference. I wish more conferences would do it!\n\nOne of the themes that really struck a chord with me was the importance of giving back to the Indigenous communities that give their knowledge, knowledge used to develop materials used to teach kids. Schools which have the ability to work with local communities to incorporate their knowledge into the curriculum must make sure that the material they develop is available to everyone. Many of the teachers present were from schools were there were only a few Indigenous students, so the materials mostly benefited non-Indigenous children. Making the resources more broadly available, in particular to other schools where more Indigenous children might be present, means the knowledge of the community can be benefiting as many Indigenous children as possible and help their learning and connection to culture.\nThe reason why this struck a chord with me is because I realised I need to do more of this in my PhD. Up until now I’d been doing research translation back our policy and community reference groups, but the research I’d done was at a broad population level. The communities want to know what the data says about their specific contexts, so I intend to shift my direction to do more community-disaggregated analysis, that’s directly relevant for these communities."

We’d all gotten to know each other so well over the past few days and there are only a handful of flights out of Gove each day, so naturally we all congregated at the terminal and kept the conference chatter alive for an extra hour or two. While I can only speak for myself, I imagine every single attendee of ATSIMA2023 is grateful to Professor Chris Matthews, Melinda Pearson, Caty Morris, and everyone else who put so much work in to make such an incredible conference happen."

    "text": "Where it all began\nI was sitting on the couch, idly scrolling Twitter, when my partner asked me “how would you feel if somebody used she to refer to you”. I paused for a bit, and came to the conclusion that it wouldn’t bother me. I hadn’t ever thought about pronouns before, since up until that point I had gone along with the idea that I was a man. My reasoning at the time was that an ‘incorrect’ pronoun didn’t really matter as long as it was clear that the pronoun being used was referring to me.\nI thought it was an interesting question, but didn’t think much more of it at the time. But in the following days my mind kept returning to that question - why doesn’t it bother me what pronouns people use? That’s when I asked myself the question\n\nAm I male?\n\nIt wasn’t a question I had an immediate answer to, but as soon as I asked it I felt some anxiety. That anxiety would come back every time my mind returned to the question. I’m not sure why I felt anxious - maybe it was the uncertainty of not knowing myself, or from challenging the male identity, or feeling that having ‘been male’ for so long I wasn’t allowed to be anything else? At any rate, the rumblings of ditching my male identity had begun, but what it was going to be replaced with I wasn’t sure."

    "text": "Trying to figure it out\nSo at this point I wasn’t quite sure what my gender identity might be, but at the very least the words ‘man’ or ‘guy’ or ‘bloke’ didn’t feel like they described me. Even arriving at these thoughts I was still second-guessing myself. People talk about having known since they were a child that their identity didn’t fit what they were being told - and that’s great! But I was modelling my expectations of understanding my own identity on this inherent ‘just knowing’, which I realise now was foolish. Everyone’s journey toward understanding themselves is different and my journey started with a feeling of ‘something’s not right but I’m not sure what that means’. In hindsight of course everyone’s journey is different, but at the time I was frustrated that I didn’t ‘just know’.\nUp until this point, my knowledge of what it meant to be non-binary was pretty superficial. I understood it meant having a gender identity that didn’t fit into the binary categories of male and female, but that was it. I did a bit of googling and learned about the umbrella that is non-binary, and all the different ways that people identify under it (e.g. genderqueer, agender, genderfluid). I thought maybe agender sounded right, but needed to dwell on it some more.\nIn doing my very academic google search I realised that I hadn’t listened to the experiences of non-binary people who were generous enough to share them (sorry for being a bad ally) - the closest I’d come was incidental thanks to Jonathan Van Ness on Queer Eye. So I sought out people talking about their experience being non-binary. One of the first articles I came across was this article on Teen Vogue. Seeing the diverse appearance and experiences of non-binary people was fantastic and really drove home that there isn’t a non-binary ‘look’.\nSerendipitously, the day that I thought I might be non-binary was actually International Non-Binary Day, which meant there were a wealth of posts on Twitter and videos on YouTube on what it means to be non-binary. This tweet thread by Professor Sandy O’Sullivan is brilliant and further challenged any preconceptions I might’ve had about non-binary people:\n\n\nHey, today (14 July) is International Non-Binary Awareness Day! Let's all be aware of fabulous non-binary people!Here's me looking all non-binary yesterday. Do you have a photo, story or a bit of appreciation to share?Some non-binary mythbusting below! pic.twitter.com/vpXEo9QVEt\n\n— Prof Sandy O'Sullivan (Wiradjuri, trans they/them) (@sandyosullivan) July 13, 2021\n\n\nThe below video (which my partner kindly sent me) has Anthony Padilla interviewing several non-binary people to do some myth-busting and talk about their experiences. This was also helpful and I’m really grateful to Jeffrey, Jacob, and Angel for being so open.\n\n\nAll of the videos and discussions of non-binary identity helped shatter my pre-conceptions of what it meant to be non-binary. The big one for me was associating androgyny with non-binary. As many non-binary folk have said, non-binary people don’t owe you androgyny. Ditching these stereotypes made it clearer to me that non-binary was something that I could indeed be."

    "text": "Struggling with it\nOne of the things I found challenging to get to grips with was that gender identity doesn’t have to stay the same. Intellectually I understood this - of course you can feel male one day, non-binary another day, then male again. Emotionally I was having a hard time, I think because I wanted to have some certainty so I could figure out the ‘right answer’ and move on. Eventually I came to terms with gender not being fixed - mostly by just dwelling on it for some time. I found reframing the question from “what is my gender identity” to “what is my gender identity at the moment” helpful. Gender didn’t need to be some immutable characteristic.\nThe next big challenge I came up against was saying words out loud. Up until now, everything had been happening in my head. But there’s a strange power in saying things out loud. At first it was awkward. I started by saying it out loud to myself. “I’m non-binary”. It felt weird and uncomfortable - like I was saying something I wasn’t meant to say - but it was also exciting. Then I said it to my partner, “hey, so I… uhhh… think I’m non-binary?” - it sounded much less certain that time. I think through practice and repetition I’ll feel more confident in owning my identity.\nIt doesn’t feel as weird to say it out loud any more, but I still feel a sense of anxiety around saying it to people. My world has gone from assuming everyone around me is kind, supportive, and understanding (which they are), to being paranoid that they’ll react negatively if I told them. It’s sad that such stigma exists, nobody should be made to feel uncomfortable about who they are.\nI reached out to a non-binary person who I knew, asking them if they’d be willing to have a chat about their experience. They were so kind and I’m so grateful that they were willing to listen to my probably silly questions and ramblings. I still felt a little unsure at the time, finding it difficult to pick the right words to describe what I was feeling, but they were reassuring and let me just talk. Talking actually turned out to be quite difficult, I think because I was still figuring out how to talk about being non-binary, but I didn’t feel like I could find the right language to use either.\nWhile I was writing this I decided to tell one of my PhD supervisors. The experience was terrifying and exhilarating. “Hey, can I tell you something? I’m non-binary”. It was abrupt but it felt right! They were kind in their reaction and asked me if I was changing my pronouns. I felt awkward because I didn’t know what reaction to expect. In one respect I felt like it was a big deal that needed celebrating, but it also doesn’t feel like a big deal because I haven’t really changed - if anything I’m more me. I must admit, in an effort to avoid any awkwardness I kept talking to fill in any potential silence and proceeded to over-explain and justify why I identified as such. On reflection, I definitely didn’t need to justify it - but I’m still learning."

It certainly wasn’t as big of a deal as I initially thought it would be. I’m still the same person, I just know myself better now.\nAn analogy that works for me is that I’d been sitting in a dark gender-identity room my whole life. In the darkness the only thing I knew was the male identity. Recently, I noticed a little gender-identity light-switch on the wall, but the light-switch was surrounded by big patriarchy signs saying “WARNING DO NOT TOUCH” and “DANGER”. So the thought of switching the light on was very scary. I had to fight the anxiety and muster up the courage to flip the switch, all the while worrying about the massive ramifications that would follow. But after turning the lights on, nothing bad happened - the signs were bullshit. In fact, nothing much happened at all - I could just see the room better.\nIt was liberating. Freeing myself from binary gender has got me challenging a lot of the things that I used to tell myself “that’s not for you”. For example, I want to get myself a cute peach-coloured jumper. It feels kinda stupid, saying that with my new found identity I want to get a colourful jumper, but honestly, feeling like I shouldn’t like colourful jumpers is the kind of dumb shit that being raised as a male in a patriarchal society teaches you."

Perhaps it never was, or perhaps it was until recently? I’ll never know since I can’t go back in time and interrogate my thoughts on my gender identity. I wrote this up and left it for a couple of days, stewing some more. I’ve started having feelings of “maybe I’m not non-binary, maybe I’m being silly” but then I return to the same question “am I a man” and the answer is still no. I don’t know what to make of that at the moment, I’ll just sit with it for now and see how I feel in the coming weeks.\nSomething I’m still aware of is my ostensibly masculine appearance. I was raised male and with that came privilege. I’ve been thinking about male privilege and how I benefit from it for far longer than I’ve been thinking about my gender identity, but this adds a new complexity. I assume people will still see me as male and treat me as such - my internal change hasn’t changed my external appearance, which is how people see me. The challenge I find is that I’m considering how other people perceive me and trying to shape my behaviour accordingly. This seems silly though, I’ll just be acting a gender identity that isn’t mine. So I’m also paying more attention to how I respond to others and trying to act in a way which is true to me, not true for what others might expect from me.\nAll in all, I’m still the same person in all the nuanced ways that make me me.

    "section": "Justification of research",
    "text": "Justification of research\nBased on my review of the literature there are several aspects of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander child removals and health that need more consideration.\n\nA more detailed analysis of child protection data\nMore up-to-date data is needed to evaluate the state of child removals in Western Australia and the outcomes of government policy over the last decade. The most current research has been based on data covering up to 2010, leaving out over a decade of child removals. The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare published more recent data in their report on child protection (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (2020a)) however it is restricted to a fairly general overview of the state of child protection across Australia. The Family Matters Report 2019 (Lewis et al. 2019) examines child protection data in a little more detail, however this still is not to the level of detail explored in studies such as Bilson et al. (2017) or Jenkins et al. (2018). Examining trends in the data in greater detail can reveal impacts of changes to policy and practice at the departmental or regional level. Having this information available will help inform what policy changes were effective, which may have had unintended consequences, and develop new policy recommendations.\nAnother reason why a more detailed examination of the child protection data is needed is previous analyses have focused on risk factors, rather than taking a strengths-based approach and examining protective factors. The overall goal of the I-CaRe WA study is to identify factors that can help reduce the number of Aboriginal children going into out-of-home care, as well ways of supporting families who are at risk and children who are already in care.\n\n\nThe need to understand the health of children going into care\nIn the qualitative interviews conducted for the I-CaRe WA study, many carers raised the issue that the Department of Communities (the agency responsible for child protection in WA) does not pass on any information about the health of the children. This lack of information creates a barrier for the child and carer to accessing adequate primary healthcare and support services. This puts the children at risk of having health issues result in more severe illness, causing increased burden on the carers as well as the hospital services. Understanding what conditions are common in these children, and breaking it down by geographic region, can help inform healthcare services provided by local Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisations and other support agencies.\nBuilding a health profile of the children in care is also relevant for policymakers for two reasons. Firstly, this can inform service planning and delivery. For example, if children are appearing in hospital data with conditions that should have been managed in a primary care setting this may indicate that the appropriate services are not available or accessible to the families who need them. This can then inform the provision of additional services or outreach programs to help families at risk and prevent their children from ending up in hospital. More outreach is certainly needed, as Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are under-represented in service usage data for services designed to support and prevent entry into the out-of-home care system (Lewis et al. 2019). Secondly, the treatment and management of health conditions has a monetary cost associated with it. Quantifying the number and type of health conditions means the monetary cost of providing this healthcare can be estimated, relevant for budgeting and funding of services.\n\n\nIdentifying protective factors and strengths of Aboriginal culture and practices\nIn addition to understanding the health of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children going into care, it would also be beneficial to identify the strengths of the communities and cultural practices which protect against ill-health and interactions with the child protection system.\nAboriginal culture and practices are important, and Aboriginal ways of being and doing are critical to the principle of self-determination. By identifying strengths of these communities, more localised support can be provided to encourage and enhance these practices.\nThe overall goal of my research is to contribute new knowledge and evidence that can be used to support Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities at risk of child protection involvement and help reduce the rate of children going into care."

    "text": "Child protection in Australia\nAustralia has a history of removing Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children from their families since colonisation, with the Stolen Generations being a very recent reminder of racist colonial practices of assimilation. The history of colonisation and the impact of these practices resulted in intergenerational trauma which is still felt by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and contributes to many challenges they face today, including deficits in parenting skills due to the disruption of families and prevention of passing on of knowledge, and high levels of substance use and mental health issues (Wilson & Wilkie 1997).\nWhile the policies underpinning the Stolen Generations came to an end in the late 1960s, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children continue to be removed from their parents at an alarming rate, as evidenced by the over-representation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children in out-of-home care. In June 2019, the national rate of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children in out-of-home care was 9.7 times higher than the rate for non-Indigenous children, with 1 in every 16.6 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children in out-of-home care (Hunter et al. 2020). Western Australia was above the national average and the highest in the country at 16.7 times higher. In a recent Western Australian government report over 56% of children and young people in care were Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander (Department of Communities 2020) despite only constituting around 6.4% of the child population (Commissioner for Children and Young People 2020). For Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children in Western Australia, placement with Indigenous carers is also below the national average at 46.9% in 2017-18 (SNAICC 2019a).\nThe tie to family, community, culture, and Country is a key part of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children’s identity and growth and intrinsic to the concept of permanency (SNAICC 2016). This aspect of permanency is formalised in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Child Placement Principle (ATSICPP), which (from SNAICC (2013)) aims to:\n\nRecognise and protect the rights of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children, family members and communities\nIncrease the level of self-determination for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in child welfare matters\nReduce the disproportionate representation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children in the child protection system.\n\nThis Principle has been adopted in jurisdictions around Australia, and, specifically in Western Australia, has been enshrined in law as part of the Child and Community Services Act 2004 (WA 2004). The ATSICPP also appears throughout policy documentation published by the Western Australian Department of Communities (hereafter referred to as ‘the Department’) over the last decade. The Department sees permanency as the most important outcome for children (Department of Communities 2017) and incorporates permanency planning into child protection cases from the beginning. Permanency, however, is defined differently by the Department, with the ATSICPP being one aspect of permanency planning. The difference in the Department’s understanding of permanency is that the critical aspect is the formation of a long-term attachment to a carer, which disregards Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander perspectives and ways of experiencing permanency (SNAICC 2019b).\nOn paper, the Department’s operations are aimed at reducing the over-representation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children in care, with policy directives stating that more Aboriginal Community-Controlled Organisations will be engaged to provide services, Department staff will be trained to provide ‘culturally safe’ services, more services will be funded to support families at risk, provision of support is preferred over removal of a child, and in the case of removal, reunification is worked towards (Department of Communities 2017, 2016a, 2016b). In addition to these positive policies, the Department’s operations have been based on the Signs of Safety framework (Department of Communities 2011) since 2011, a framework which encourages real relationship building between families involved and various professionals, and the consideration of strengths of parents and opportunities for safety, rather than operating in a purely risk-averse way (Turnell & Edwards 1999).\nThe combination of the ATSICPP being embedded in the legal framework and the various policy documents from the last decade would suggest that a reduction would have been achieved. This is unfortunately not the case, with the rate and number of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children in out-of-home care increasing yearly for at least the past decade."

    "section": "Key definitions",
    "text": "Key definitions\nBefore exploring the research on child protection issues in Australia I will first define some key terminology used by the Department and in research more generally.\nMaltreatment of a child is categorised into four broad categories, of which several can be present at the same time:\n\nNeglect - when a child does not receive adequate food or shelter, medical treatment, supervision, care or nurturance to such an extent that their development is damaged or they are injured (Department of Communities 2012a).\nPhysical abuse - when a child is severely and/or persistently hurt or injured by an adult or a child’s caregiver. It may also be the result of putting a child at risk of being injured (Department of Communities 2012b).\nSexual abuse - when a child is exposed to, or involved in, sexual activity that is inappropriate to the child’s age and developmental level (Department of Communities 2012c).\nEmotional abuse - when an adult harms a child’s development by repeatedly treating and speaking to a child in ways that damage the child’s ability to feel and express their feelings (Department of Communities 2012d).\n\nIn the child protection system in Western Australia there are four broad stages:\n\nNotification - where an individual raises concern for a child’s welfare to the Department. These individuals can be anyone, however they tend to be police officers, healthcare workers, and teachers, in part because these groups of professionals are subject to mandatory reporting of sexual abuse (Children and Community Services Amendment (Reporting Sexual Abuse of Children) Act 2008).\nInvestigation - if a notification includes a concern of maltreatment, abandonment, death, or inadequate provision of care, then the department may choose to investigate.\nSubstantiation - after case worker from the Department investigates the report, interviewing relevant parties, they decide whether the concern is substantiated. The three outcomes here are “unsubstantiated”, “substantiated - significant harm (actual)” where actual harm to a child has been substantiated, or “substantiated likelihood of significant harm (has or will occur)” where no harm was substantiated but the investigator believes there is a great risk of harm to the child. This is the stage at which the types of maltreatment are identified.\nConclusion - depending on the evidence in the investigation, the conclusion can result in no action, the provision of support services to address issues of concern, or the removal of a child from their parents.\n\nThe latter two outcomes at the conclusion stage usually lead to a protection order being issued. These protection orders are either temporary (up to two years long) or permanent (until the age of 18). There are four kinds of protection order in the legal framework which governs child protection (WA 2004):\n\nSupervision - this temporary order leaves the child in the care of the parents, but the Department supervises the care of the child. This may include conditions that the parents must meet in order to satisfy the concerns of the Department.\nTime-limited - this temporary order assigns the Department parental responsibility of the child (which usually means removal from the parents).\nUntil 18 - a permanent version of the time-limited order, where the Department is assigned parental responsibility until the child turns 18 or is adopted, or the order is revoked.\nSpecial guardianship - a permanent order where up to two individuals are given parental responsibility for a child until the age of 18. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children must be placed according to the ATSICPP for this order.\n\nThe overall framework of the child protection system is represented in Figure 1.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: An overview of the child protection system in Western Australia"

    "text": "Trends in child protection data\nIn a study of Aboriginal children born in Western Australia in 1990 and 1991 and followed up until their 18th birthday, Bilson et al. (2015) found an estimated 41.8% were reported to child protective services, compared to 11% of non-Aboriginal children. In fact, Aboriginal children were more likely to appear across all stages of the child protection system - they were 3.8 times more likely to be reported, 4.1 times more likely to be investigated, and 5.3 times more likely to have substantiated maltreatment. In the Northern Territory, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children were similarly over-represented in rates of notification (4.6 times) and substantiation (3.7 times) (Guthridge et al. 2012).\nAnother trend in child protection data has been children entering out-of-home care at younger ages and remaining in care for longer periods. The proportion of children in Western Australia entering care for the first time under the age of one rose from 15.3% to 24.8% between 1996 and 2009 (Bilson et al. 2017). In New South Wales, a more recent study of all children who started school in 2009 or 2012 found by age 1, 5.4% had a notification and 0.5% had been placed in out-of-home care, increasing to 13.8% and 1.4% respectively by age 5. These percentages seem small but they still represent over 2,100 children in out-of-home care by the age of five. This trend of increasingly younger entry into out-of-home care is even stronger in South Australia. Segal et al. (2019) estimated the cumulative incidence rates for five different birth cohorts (the earliest of which was births between 1986-91 and the latest was 2010-17), showing an acceleration of the percentage of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children in out-of-home care at younger ages. Spending longer time in out-of-home care is also naturally correlated with earlier entry into out-of-home care as the younger a child is when they enter the system, the more potential years they have to spend in it.\nAn interesting effect of policy change can be observed with the implementation of the Child and Community Services Act 2004 (WA 2004). There was a sharp rise in the number of notifications and investigations by the Department, however the rate of substantiation did not change (Bilson et al. 2017). This is illustrative of how a policy or operational change can have a great impact on the data being recorded but the reality of the situation is not changing. Figure 2 illustrates the changes in the data - note that the 2004 Act was not implemented until 2006, indicated by the change in shading of the bars representing notifications. A later amendment to the Act (Children and Community Services Amendment (Reporting Sexual Abuse of Children) Act 2008) also made it mandatory for certain professionals, e.g. police, teachers, to report concerns of sexual abuse, which also resulted in an increase in the number of notifications for sexual abuse.\n Source: Bilson et al.

    "text": "Factors associated with child protection interaction\nThe rate of interactions and removals in the child protection system have been well documented. Several studies have examined which characteristics are related to increasing appearance in the data. Studies on this topic typically rely on administrative data linked with various sources of health information, using the data linkage to estimate the risk associated with particular characteristics. Data linkage can be a powerful way to access large amounts of data on a variety of different topics, however it has some drawbacks. One key issue is identifying Indigenous status. It has been documented that Indigenous people hesitate to identify in healthcare settings, such as hospitals, for fear of mistreatment and discrimination (Christensen et al. 2014). Methods have been developed to improve the quality of Indigenous identifiers, such as comparing the status across multiple different datasets including birth records and family relations. McNamara et al. (2020) demonstrated the use of Indigenous status across family members (i.e. child, parent, and grandparents) to derive a child’s Indigenous status was a more inclusive method than relying on Indigenous status of only the child across datasets. This relies on having multiple datasets available in a linkage, which means studies relying solely on the analysis of hospital records are very likely underestimating the number of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in the data.\nIn the research published on risk factors for entry into the child protection system, the following have consistently been identified to increase the risk of a child having substantiated maltreatment and entering out-of-home care:\n\nMaternal and paternal substance use (O’Donnell et al. 2010, 2015; Jenkins et al. 2018; Orr et al. 2019)\nPoor maternal or paternal mental health (O’Donnell et al. 2010, 2015; Jenkins et al. 2018)\nTeenage mother or father (Orr et al. 2019; O’Donnell et al. 2019)\nMaternal hospital admissions for assault (O’Donnell et al. 2010, 2015; Orr et al. 2019)\nExposure to family domestic violence (Jenkins et al. 2018; Orr et al. 2019)\nLiving in socioeconomically disadvantaged areas (O’Donnell et al. 2010; Orr et al. 2019; Segal et al. 2019)\n\nSeveral congenital conditions have been associated with increased risk of appearing in child protection data. O’Donnell et al. (2010) reported hazard ratios for intellectual disability and cerebral palsy and other birth defects of 1.86 and 1.48 respectively. O’Donnell et al. (2009) also found that Aboriginal mothers were twice as likely to have a child born with neonatal withdrawal syndrome and identified poor maternal mental health and smoking during pregnancy as risk factors for being born with neonatal withdrawal syndrome - the same risk factors for having a child appear in child protection data.\nThese parental characteristics and health issues are only part of the picture though. There are common causes that underlie poor child and maternal health and appearing in child protection data - poverty, intergenerational trauma, systemic racism, lack of support or access to support services, poor housing and homelessness (Hunter et al. 2020)."

    "text": "Health of children\nThe health conditions identified previously have been those associated with increased risk of appearing in child protection data, but what does the overall health of these children going into care look like? This is an important question since carers taking on children need to ensure appropriate healthcare is provided, which means healthcare services need to be available and accessible. This information can also be used to inform early-intervention services to promote good development and wellbeing while children are young - a strategy which has been documented to be more cost effective than treating ill-health and other negative outcomes later in life (Alperstein & Dyer 2012). Providing support early on is not just about preventing ill-health either, good health has influences on every aspect of a child’s life, including education and social activities (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare 2020b).\nGood health begins for a child during pregnancy and the first years of life. The health of the mother during pregnancy impacts birth outcomes, with behaviours like smoking and substance use (factors also associated with child protection involvement) contributing to poor outcomes like low birthweight, which is itself a risk factor for several health conditions in adulthood, such as diabetes (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare 2020b). It has also been found that mothers who experienced family domestic violence (again, another factor for child protection involvement) are twice as likely to give birth to a low birthweight baby (Brown et al. 2015). The provision and uptake of early-intervention support services can help reduce the likelihood of poor prospective health, however this will not change the health needs of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children already in, and at risk of going into, out-of-home care.\nThe Australia’s Children report (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare 2020b) gives an overview of the general burden of disease among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children. Asthma and mental health conditions are the leading causes of disease burden among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children aged 0-14. For Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children under five, the leading chronic health conditions were infant and congenital conditions (such as complications of low birthweight and pre-term birth) while for children aged 5 to 14 the leading causes of health burden were conduct, anxiety, and depressive disorders, asthma, and dental caries. While mental health conditions are common amongst children generally, children in out-of-home care are at even greater risk of experiencing poor mental health (Jones 2017).\nOn a positive note however, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children have high rates of immunisation at age two (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare 2020b). The Australia’s Children report acknowledges that data for children living in out-of-home care is limited, demonstrating that even the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, a government organisation that has access to large and varied datasets, struggles to get information on the health of children in out-of-home care. This further highlights the need to make health information on children in out-of-home care available.\nFew studies have been published on the health of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children in out-of-home care, and the ones that do use highly-localised samples from service providers, limiting their generalisability. In a study of children attending KARI Aboriginal Resources Inc. clinics in south-western Sydney, half of the children had incomplete immunisation schedules (Raman, Reynolds & Khan 2011). This is an important contrast to what is reported in the Australia’s Children report, suggesting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children at risk of entry into out-of-home care may be a subgroup of the larger Indigenous child population, who experience differential rates of health and healthcare. A follow up study consistently found hearing, vision, dental issues in children across several years (prevalences ranging from 30% to 50%), and several developmental deficits in the areas of speech and language and fine motor skills (Raman et al. 2017). Of the health conditions reported in Australia’s Children, asthma, visual impairment, and behavioural problems were common in the children in out-of-home care. Shmerling et al. (2020) conducted a similar analysis of children seen by the Victorian Aboriginal Health service. The same set of respiratory, hearing, visual, and dental issues were found as those in Raman et al. (2017), with prevalences ranging from 30% to 50% in children aged 0 to 13. Mental health and behavioural difficulties as well as delays to speech development were similarly prevalent. As far as I have been able to determine, no similar studies are published on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children in out-of-home care in Western Australia. It is important to capture this information as the geography and climate of Western Australia is very different to Victoria and New South Wales, with a far greater proportion of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people living in remote and very remote locations (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare 2019a) - a characteristic associated with greater experience of poor health (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare 2020b; Department of Health Western Australia 2021)."

    "section": "Potentially preventable hospitalisations",
    "text": "Potentially preventable hospitalisations\nOne source of administrative data that can provide a glimpse into the health of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children in care is hospital and emergency department data. By linking these data with child protection data we can examine what health conditions children are presenting to hospital with (similar to O’Donnell et al. (2015)). While this methodology is powerful, it does not provide information on primary care visits, so we may be less likely to see health conditions that can be managed in a primary care setting. However, this presents an opportunity to consider the health service utilisation and availability by examining potentially preventable hospitalisations.\nPotentially preventable hospitalisations (PPHs) are “defined as hospital admissions that could have potentially been prevented through the provision of appropriate individualised preventative health interventions and early disease management” (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare 2019b). These hospitalisations can be used as a metric to understand how effective and accessible healthcare services are in a community. If there is a high rate of PPHs in a community it suggests that there is a lack of accessible healthcare services, or those services that are available are not sufficiently addressing the health needs of the community. It should be noted however that PPHs will occur more frequently in areas where there are higher rates of disease, so higher rates do not necessarily imply that the primary care system is less effective.\nPotentially preventable hospitalisations are generally categorised into three groups:\n\nVaccine-preventable conditions - further categorised into ‘Influenza and pneumonia’ and ‘Other vaccine-preventable’. The majority of these admissions tend to be influenza and pneumonia, and Hepatitis C accounts for the majority of admissions in the ‘other’ category (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare 2019b).\nAcute conditions - which are quick onset conditions that may not have needed hospitalisation if adequate and timely primary care was provided.\nChronic conditions - hospitalisation for these conditions may have been avoidable through management in the community or lifestyle changes.\n\nEven though there are many conditions that fall under these different categories it is important to note that hospitalisation for such conditions may not have actually been avoidable.\nOf the few studies published that examine rates of PPHs in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children, they have all found consistently higher rates of admission compared to non-Indigenous children, ranging from:\n\n1.7 in children aged 1 to 4 and 11 in children aged 28 days to 1 year (Stamp, Duckett & Fisher 1998), based on an analysis of NSW/NT/QLD/SA/WA data using admissions per 1,000 population\n4 in children aged 0 to 14 (Li et al. 2009), based on an analysis of admissions per 100,000 population in the NT between 1998 and 2006\n1.7 in children aged 0 to 13, based on an analysis of PPHs per 1,000 person-years observed from 2000 to 2012 in NSW (Falster et al. 2016)\n\nThese findings are consistent with the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (2019b), which reports Indigenous Australians experience PPHs at a rate three times greater than non-Indigenous Australians - a finding that is consistent irrespective of remoteness area (however the rate does increase with increasing remoteness).\nIn a study of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children from the Australian Capital Territory aged 0 to 5, nearly a quarter of PPHs were due to respiratory disease, with injury and infectious disease also in the top 5 (Guthrie 2012). The health categories being found for PPHs is also consistent with nationally published data which finds chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder is the leading cause of PPHs for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and is experienced at a rate 5.4 times greater than that for non-Indigenous people (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare 2020c). The other common conditions causing PPHs reported were diabetes complications, rheumatic heart disease, and in children, ear, nose, and throat infections. These data are predominantly for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people of all ages, using age-standardised rates. Very few studies focus specifically on, or report separately, PPHs in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children. One of the few studies which does, a study in New South Wales, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children were admitted more frequently for every condition, with respiratory and infectious disease conditions among the most common (Falster et al. 2016)."

    "text": "Conclusion\nTo summarise, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children experience similar types of health conditions in their disease burden, but the rate at which it is experienced is disproportionately higher than non-Indigenous children. These children are also over-represented in out-of-home care and the child protection system more generally. There are a variety of factors causing this over-representation, such as poverty, systemic racism, and intergenerational trauma, which ultimately is the result of colonisation and the continuing lack of support for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. Research has examined the health of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children generally, but there is little published on the general health of children who enter out-of-home care. Additionally, a more up-to-date analysis is needed for Western Australian child protection data to examine the recent trends in greater detail."

The cohort consists of approximately 33,000 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children born in Western Australia and their siblings, parents, and grandparents. In terms of the data linkage methodology, the central linking unit (i.e. the individual to which the other family members are linked to) are Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children born in Western Australia between 2000 and 2013. Siblings of these children born outside of those years, as well as parents and grandparents, are included in the linkage. There is maternal information for all children, however paternal information is missing for some children. Grandparental information is missing in some cases too, such as where no father is recorded on a birth certificate, or the mother was born interstate so her birth record is not available to link. The full list of data sources in the data linkage, along with the range of years for each data source, are listed below:\n\nChild Protection and Family Support Data (1979-2019)\nMidwives Notification System (1980-2019)\nBirth registrations (1945-2019)\nHospital Morbidity Database Collection (1970-2019)\nEmergency Department Database Collection (2002-2019)\nWA Notifications of Notifiable Infectious Diseases (1964-2019)\nWA Register of Developmental Abnormalities - Birth defects (1980-2019)\nWA Register of Developmental Abnormalities - Cerebral Palsy (1980-2019)\nIntellectual Disability Exploring Answers\nDeath registrations (1969-2019)\nWA Infant, Child, Youth Mortality database\nMental Health Information System (1966-2019)\nMental Health National Outcomes and Casemix Collection\nDrug and Alcohol Office (1985-2005)\n\nDifferent statistical methods and datasets will used to address the research question for each chapter."

The results of my searches include government reports and policy documentation, technical documentation, and research articles and reports. I have synthesised the information presented in these different sources into a narrative review which explores the history and trends in the child protection system, nationally and in Western Australia, as well as the health of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children and families in relation to child protection.\nTasks for this chapter:\n\n\n\n\n\nItem\nDue\nProgress\n\n\n\n\nIdentify search topics\nApr 2020\nComplete\n\n\nPerform literature search\nMay 2020\nComplete\n\n\nRead literature\nDec 2020\nComplete\n\n\nDraft child protection review\nJan 2021\nComplete\n\n\nDraft child health review\nMar 2021\nNear completion\n\n\nFinalise literature review\nMay 2021\nIn progress\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 2 - Methodology\nIn this chapter I will be explaining the data sources and describing the cohort and data linkage methodology.

The cohort will be described on a variety of characteristics, including:\n\nNumber of children\nNumber of child years observed in the child protection data\nNumber of siblings (half- and full-), parents (mother and father) and number of grandparents (maternal and paternal)\nAverage and range of duration of follow-up\nAverage and range of number of interactions with the child protection system\nAverage and range of number of admissions in the hospital and emergency data\nRate of missing data and censoring\n\nI will also cover some statistical methodologies I have planned to use in subsequent chapters which involve data analysis and statistical modelling.\nTasks for this chapter:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem\nDue\nProgress\n\n\n\n\nDraft description of the data and data linkage\nJun 2021\nNot started\n\n\nDraft of proposed analysis methods\nJun 2021\nNot started\n\n\nCoding of the cohort\nJuly 2021\nIn progress\n\n\nDescriptives of the cohort\nJuly 2021\nNot started\n\n\nFinalise chapter\nAug 2021\nNot started\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 3 - Descriptive analysis of trends in the child protection system\nAim: Quantify contemporary trends in WA child protection data, examining the rates in different areas of the child protection system such as the different stages (notification through to conclusion) or types of maltreatment.\nThis chapter will be a descriptive analysis, I will not be fitting any statistical models to the data. I will examine the trends in the four stages (notification, investigation, substantiation, placement in out-of-home care) and trends in the different maltreatment categories (neglect, physical abuse, emotional abuse, sexual abuse). The methods used for this chapter will mainly be data visualisation and tabulation. The results will be presented in terms of rates of interactions per 1,000 children, and broken down by key characteristics like age at interaction or child sex.\nI plan to submit this paper for publication by December 2021. The current authorship team includes my four supervisors (Sandra Eades, Alison Gibberd, Bridgette McNamara, Koen Simons) as well as Dan MacAulay (ECU) and Kathleen Falster (UNSW) from the study advisory group.\nTasks for this chapter:\n\n\n\n\n\nItem\nDue\nProgress\n\n\n\n\nOrganise authorship team\nJun 2021\nComplete\n\n\nDraft aims of paper\nJun 2021\nIn progress\n\n\nAnalyse the data\nOct 2021\nNot started\n\n\nWrite up the paper\nNov 2021\nIn progress\n\n\nSubmit the paper\nDec 2021\nNot started\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 4 - Causal pathways to the child protection system\nAim: Use directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to synthesise the literature on child protection and health into a framework which attempts to capture the complexity of the variables involved in both child protection and child health.\nThis chapter does not require the use of any data, the focus is to produce a theoretical framework which can guide my future analyses. I will be drawing heavily on the published research covered in the literature review to build a DAG. By building this framework I also hope to improve understanding of the complex inter-relatedness and causality of the different factors, going beyond simple associations.\nAs I have been reading the literature on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health and child protection issues I have been building a mental map of how I think different variables are related to each other. My current thoughts are captured in Figure 3.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: A theoretical DAG for Indigenous child protection and health\n\n\nTasks for this chapter:\n\n\n\n\n\nItem\nDue\nProgress\n\n\n\n\nDraft aims of the chapter\nDec 2021\nNot started\n\n\nBuild causal framework\nJan 2022\nIn progress\n\n\nWrite up chapter\nFeb 2022\nNot started\n\n\nSeek feedback and make edits\nMar 2022\nNot started\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 5 - Health profile of children going into care\nAim: Describe the general health of children prior to entering out-of-home care, examining common conditions and their trends in time and geography and variation by age.\nIn this chapter I plan to build a general health profile of the children who go into care in an effort to understand the health burden placed on carers.\nThe analysis will be descriptive, drawing on data visualisation and summaries to examine which conditions are appearing in the health data prior to entry into out-of-home care. This chapter will also explore the health service utilisation by comparing potentially preventable hospitalisations before and after being placed in care. One hypothesis is that parents whose children end up in out-of-home care may have poor access to primary healthcare and support services, so conditions which could have been treated or managed by primary care and other support services will be more likely to appear in the hospital and emergency admissions data. Once a child is placed into out-of-home care the carer may have better access to primary care services, so will be less likely to see potentially preventable hospitalisations for the child in the admissions data after placement into out-of-home care.\nTasks for this chapter:\n\n\n\n\n\nItem\nDue\nProgress\n\n\n\n\nOrganise authorship team\nApr 2022\nNot started\n\n\nDraft aims of the paper\nApr 2022\nNot started\n\n\nAnalyse data\nMay 2022\nNot started\n\n\nWrite up paper\nJul 2022\nNot started\n\n\nSubmit paper\nAug 2022\nNot started\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 6 - Exposed vs. unexposed comparison of health outcomes\nAim: Compare the health outcomes and health service utilisation for children depending on their level of interaction with the child protection system.\nUsing a retrospective cohort design I will construct different cohorts to perform these comparisons. The exposed and unexposed groups will be children who are placed in out-of-home care and children who are never placed in out-of-home care, respectively. Depending on the further consultation with the study advisory group and the community and policy reference groups the analysis can be extended to compare children who ever appear in the child protection data (as opposed to only those who go into out-of-home care) with those who never do. Survival analysis methods may be used to estimate hazard ratios for the two cohorts.\nTasks for this chapter:\n\n\n\n\n\nItem\nDue\nProgress\n\n\n\n\nOrganise authorship team\nSep 2022\nNot started\n\n\nDraft aims of the paper\nSep 2022\nNot started\n\n\nAnalyse data\nOct 2022\nNot started\n\n\nWrite up paper\nDec 2022\nNot started\n\n\nSubmit paper\nJan 2023\nNot started"

Each time, up until now, I figured if I did just a little more advocacy behind the scenes or gave the leadership at Significance magazine and the ASA or RSS a little more time, maybe they would actually do something.\nAlas, this wasn’t to be.\nAnd that’s not for lack of trying either. Before getting into whatever this blog post is (a rant maybe?), I do want to acknowledge there have been multiple people across the American Statistical Association (ASA), Royal Statistical Society (RSS), and Statistical Society of Australia (SSA), with varying degrees of authority and seniority, who have also taken issue with the article and spent time advocating for some kind of action. I say this to highlight that the fact the article remains published, and is thus endorsed as an article of quality and merit by Significance magazine, does not necessarily reflect the perspectives of the membership bases of the aforementioned professional bodies or the editorial board of Significance magazine."

    "text": "Where to begin?\nAt the start I guess, which was the first time I read the article. My initial reaction was one of disbelief. How did this article manage to get published in the first place? Putting aside the fact that it was clearly a political piece with a transphobic agenda (and this is my main issue), the article is so poorly written that it reads like some of my first-year undergraduate essays, and boy were some of those cringe.\nYou might be tempted to pick through the article and compile a list of all the issues it has - but I’ll save you the effort. I did that already and sent this complaint to the editor of Significance magazine. The length of the complaint was actually longer than the article itself, which maybe tells you something about how poor the article is. To summarise my issues with the article, it:\n\nAdvocates for genuinely terrible data collection practices\nFalsely claims that governments are not collecting data on sex\nSuggests there’s a queer illuminati trying to ‘erase sex categories’\nProvides citations which, in the majority of cases, directly contradict the claims they are cited against\nIs riddled with logical fallacies like straw-man arguments and appeals to tradition\nDisingenuously defines sex, gender, and gender identity in relation to binaries\nUses dehumanising language, like describing intersex people as ‘anomalous’\n\nI could go on, but if you want to know more you may as well read the complaint. After sending in the complaint I received… silence. I emailed again two weeks later to again receive silence. Finally after following up a third time, more than a month since the initial submission, I received a response from the editor basically saying “yes I got your email”. Nothing else, so again I had to follow up to see what was being done and finally received this disappointing reply:\n\nThere won’t be any action taken. The article went through the same process as every Significance article (besides interviews, book reviews etc), including a review by members of our editorial board. I’m satisfied that, as a magazine, our coverage of this issue has been balanced.\n\nLmao what? Coverage of ‘this issue’? Are you also actively seeking out anti-vaccine opinions too for the sake of balance?\nAnyway, this reply made me cringe with even more second-hand embarrassment - not only did the original author submit the article with all of its issues but someone on the editorial board apparently read it and went “oh wow this article is fantastic and has no problems at all we should publish it immediately”.\nI kept advocating for something to be done about the article, but nothing eventuated despite what seemed to be considerable discussion on the magazine’s editorial board, on each society’s DEI committees, between the Presidents of the respective societies. Again, I am grateful that many people pursued this issue on my, and many others, behalf, but I am ultimately still disappointed."

    "section": "Why does this matter?",
    "text": "Why does this matter?\nWell for starters, publishing articles like this poses a serious risk to the eye health of trans and gender diverse statisticians from all the eye-rolling it induces. For real though, I’d been thinking of writing a piece for Significance magazine’s competition for early career statisticians, but given this entire debacle I don’t see the magazine as a safe or welcoming place for me or my work. Honestly, if it wasn’t for the support I received from my colleagues at the SSA, I wouldn’t even be sure that the SSA was a safe or welcoming place for me. But not every trans or gender diverse statistician has that relationship with one of the professional bodies, so what are they to make of Significance magazine and the professional societies that govern it?\nAnd this gets to a broader issue I have with organisations being very happy to say they are welcoming and inclusive. It’s easy to say you are a welcoming and inclusive organisation, it’s easy write it into your strategic plan, and it’s easy to do work that makes you feel good, like celebrating the International Day of Women in Statistics and Data Science. But when it comes to doing something hard or uncomfortable, like retracting a transphobic article which goes directly against your principles of inclusivity, all of a sudden there’s nothing to be done. It’s just so disappointing and yet so unsurprising.\nMy other issue is that Significance magazine is considered to be a reputable publication and this quality is conferred to the articles within it. At a surface level the article itself looks reputable too, having the trappings of an academic article. This appearance of legitimacy then leads to the cycle of academic bullshittery:\n\nArticle is published, giving it a degree of legitimacy\nPeople cite the article in their own publications, taking the arguments at face value, giving it further legitimacy\nPeople read this other work, take the citation of the original article at face value and cite it in their own work.\nRinse and repeat, until you have Dan Ariely\n\nUnfortunately and unsurprisingly, my concerns about this cycle have come true and publications in actual academic journals are citing this article. What kind of article would cite this you ask? Why one also full of transphobia, of course! Like this delightful one, that can’t help but talk about transgender women and the sexual abuse of children in the same sentence whilst also citing every TERF’s favourite ex-comedy writer, Graham Linehan.\nIf we put aside the transphobic nature of the article for a moment (and I’d prefer we didn’t), any statistician worth their salt should have picked up on the terrible advice the article gives in relation to data collection. If you’ve ever had to provide statistical consulting on a project you didn’t initiate, you’ll understand that unless researchers collect data that specifically measure the thing they’re interested in, no amount of statistical wizardry can save their research.\nSo why did a magazine run by statisticians publish an article that advocates for not considering the nuances of your research question at all, and instead pushes a political agenda to only collect data on sex and that (wrongly) defines sex in such a limited way? And no, I don’t consider the throwaway line “Data on gender identity should also be collected in contexts where it may be relevant and useful” to be a get-out-of-jail-free card, when the ~2,000 words preceding it argue the complete opposite. Imagine if someone spent ten minutes saying horribly racist things to you and at the end went ‘SIKE!’. Yeah I don’t buy it either."

But my issue is significant and remains unaddressed.\nThere do also seem to have been some positive things arising out of this debacle. By publishing the article, Significance magazine has spurred on some internal developments across the different professional bodies, which will hopefully lead to improved editorial standards when it comes to articles about minorities and politicised populations.\nThe other positive is that the article is like a canary in a coal mine - it’s nice to know which academics to be wary of based on those who unironically cite it in their own work."

These were predominantly academic positions, and being employed by an Australian university meant my salary was tied to very specific pay bands. I was happy to be working full-time, having been working weekends and studying full-time for the last year and a half. Going from working a minimum-wage casual retail job to earning a full-time Level A wage felt good by comparison.\nI’d wanted to do a PhD for a long time, but now that I was earning a full-time wage my partner and I were able to work toward financial goals. The prospect of being a broke PhD student was not appealing. This didn’t have to be the case though, as I found out after I chatted to a friend of mine who suggested working a couple of days in addition to doing a PhD. I ran the numbers and he was right, if I was able to secure a PhD scholarship (~$30,000 a year tax-free at the time) and work two days a week, my net income was almost the same as my current full-time income as a research assistant.\nWith this in mind, I figured I may as well do a PhD. Graduate researchers are a source of cheap labour and the work would be similar to what I was currently doing. And since the money was practically the same, why not spend the next 3 to 4 years doing the same work and earning the same money, but ending up with a PhD and in turn increasing my earning potential? Well it turns out the work wasn’t the same as being a research assistant (there is a LOT more independence), but the pay was at least the same.\nAt the time however, I wasn’t passionate about any area in particular. I just really enjoyed coding and was agnostic to the context that I was doing it. So how does that turn into a PhD?"

You either start a PhD because you’re passionate about something, or you see it as a job that’s a stepping stone to further your career. I was certainly in the latter category initially, however my passion for my topic developed over the course of my PhD.\nSince I didn’t know what I wanted to do, I looked for projects being advertised that were suited to my skills in an area that I thought was interesting. I happened across an advert on the Statistical Society of Australia’s job forum. I saw an advert for a quantitative PhD student to do research into the health outcomes of Aboriginal children in out-of-home care using linked administrative data. I’ve always wanted the work I do to have meaning, be helpful, and ‘do good’ and this project ticked all of those boxes.\nDespite my developing passion for the topic, I still treated my PhD like a job. Besides the last 3 months of ‘crunch’, I never worked evenings or weekends. I worked 9 to 5, five days a week - three being on my PhD and two being in my job. The advent of covid and remote working was a boon, because it meant I could be a lot more flexible with my time. Some weeks I might work 5 days on my PhD and make up work days at a later date - as long as the work got done nobody minded."

    "text": "Things that were difficult\nThere are many difficult parts to doing a PhD, which are usually difficult because you’ve never done them before. I think it’s useful to remember that if something is difficult it probably means you’re learning, and that’s a good thing. Realising this doesn’t make it any less difficult mind you.\n\nWorking on the same thing, for a long time\nThe most difficult part of the PhD for me was completing my first research article. My assessment at the start was that the code would only take a couple of weeks to write, the write-up might take another month, so budgeting three months to have my first draft ready was being generous. In reality, two years passed between the first meeting to discuss the aims of the article and when it was finally published.\nMy expectations for how long the process would take didn’t improve either. For the next article, I still thought three months was a reasonable timeframe. It took nine months from start to submission. The third article took five months from start to submission. With practice and experience, I’ve certainly became more efficient with my time, but I’m still terrible at estimating how long something will take.\nFor the longest time, the disconnection between my expectation of how long it should take and how long it was actually taking made me feel very stupid. This feeling of stupidity also turned into resentment at times - I didn’t want to get feedback from data custodians, I didn’t want reviewer comments, I just wanted the research to be done.\n\n\nDealing with feedback\nI’ve gotten much better at separating myself from my work, in that I don’t see feedback as a criticism of who I am, I see it as an opportunity to improve my work. I do still feel a whole host of emotions when I receive feedback, because after all I thought the work was good enough to submit for review. My advice for managing feedback is to read the feedback during work hours, but only read it. Do not respond to it, just let your mind dwell on it and return to it the next day. This lets you feel whatever emotions you’re going to feel on your initial reading of the feedback and by sleeping on it you’ll return to it with a clearer mind and give more measured responses.\n\n\nMotivation\nI struggled a LOT with motivation. It felt like days or weeks would go by and I hadn’t done anything at all. Then I’d have periods of enormous productivity. Unfortunately, being extremely productive in a short period of time didn’t alleviate the guilt I experienced during my unproductive periods. I was forever beating myself up for not being able to have productive periods all the time. Being diagnosed with ADHD 8 months before I was due to finish wasn’t ideal, but better late than never I guess.\nDeadlines were a mixed source of motivation. External deadlines were excellent - I’m very good at being accountable to someone else. Things like candidature milestones or submission deadlines were very successful motivators. Setting my own deadlines was not so good, sometimes I’d be able to meet them, but often I’d feel guilty because I wasn’t meeting them - a problem exacerbated by my terrible ability to know how long things should take.\n\n\nMental health\nIf you speak to practically anyone that’s done a PhD, they’ll tell you that their mental health suffered. This was true for me and living in Victoria (Australia) during covid lockdowns certainly didn’t help. I think my perspective on hardship, that feeling like shit is usually temporary, helped carry me through it all though. I’m not suggesting you change your mentality though (“have you tried just not being depressed?”), so here’s some other things that also helped get me through:\n\nMy partner, who supported me in many ways through the whole process\nMy supervisors, who were kind, supportive, and understanding throughout the process\nMy greyhound(s), who love their routines and will not let you skip a walk (getting out of the house was good)\nDoing things that made me happy, which at the time were cooking, brewing beer, gardening, and playing video games\nSeeing a psychologist (do this even if you aren’t doing a PhD)"

    "text": "Replicating the Hugo Academic URL structure\nThe main thing I wanted to do was replicate my old website in that the home page contained my bio and some external links, with my blog posts on a separate page. To do this I started off making a new ‘Quarto Blog’ project in RStudio following the documentation on Quarto’s website. It’s important to select blog, not website at this step.\nThe very first thing you want to do is swap the YAML between the about.qmd and index.qmd files. This is because index.qmd is the home page for your website. Quarto’s default is to make the blog your home page, but we don’t want that. Swapping the YAML puts your bio as the home page. I also renamed the posts folder to post, just in case that mattered but I’m not sure it does.\nThe next thing is to rename about.qmd to post.qmd. This is now your main page for your blog and it has the same URL structure as the old Hugo Academic template. This means when you migrate your blog posts from your old to your new website, the URLs won’t break. Yay!"

    "section": "Migrating blog posts",
    "text": "Migrating blog posts\n\nKeeping URLs consistent\nQuarto’s method of organising files used in blog posts is way better than blogdown/Hugo. Instead of having a .Rmd file in the post folder and keeping all the content in a separate location (was it in static? I never remember), you have one folder per blog post and all the files go in that folder. I.e.:\n-   post\n  -   2024-11-25-quarto-migration\n  -   2024-08-10-phd-reflection\n  -   etc.\nThe name of each blog post’s folder will be used to create the URL. This means if you want to keep the URLs of your blog posts the same, you must give each blog post’s folder the same name as the original .Rmd file.\nTo copy the content across, just copy and paste the original .Rmd file and rename it to index.qmd. Note the change in extension from .Rmd to .qmd.\nFor example, my blog post reflecting on my PhD experience was originally written in a file called 2024-08-10-phd-reflection.Rmd. This means I would create a folder within the post folder called 2024-08-10-phd-reflection, put my original blog post file 2024-08-10-phd-reflection.Rmd inside this folder and rename the file to index.qmd. Building on the above example, this would look like:\n-   post\n  -   2024-11-25-quarto-migration\n  -   2024-08-10-phd-reflection\n    -   index.qmd\n  -   etc.\n\n\nTranslating .Rmd to .qmd files\nNow you’ve changed your original .Rmd files to .qmd files by just renaming them, you’ll need to fix some of the YAML.\nThe main thing is to delete tags: []. Quarto only uses categories. Without knowing what other YAML options you were using it’s hard to say what else needs to change but if you try and render your website it will either work or not work, and if it doesn’t work something still needs fixing.\nAn example of the YAML for my PhD reflection blog post is:\n\nOld .Rmd YAMLNew .qmd YAML\n\n\ntitle: \"Reflecting on my PhD experience\"\nauthor: \"Ben Harrap\"\ndate: 2024-08-10\ncategories: [\"Academic\", \"Self\"]\ntags: [\"Academic\",\"PhD\",\"Research\",\"Learning\"]\n\n\ntitle: \"Reflecting on my PhD experience\"\nauthor: \"Ben Harrap\"\ndate: 2024-08-10\ncategories: \n  -   academia\n  -   self\n  -   phd\n\n\n\n\n\nMoving images, files, etc.\nIf your old blog posts referenced any files, such as images, you’ll need to move them to the new blog post’s folder and update the path in your blog post’s new index.qmd file. My confirmation report blog post is a good example of this, it uses images, a bibliography, and a .csl file. After moving all the resources to the blog post’s folder, I updated the YAML:\n\nOld Rmd YAMLNew YAML\n\n\nbibliography: [../../static/post/confirmation-report/references.bib]\ncsl: [../../static/post/confirmation-report/harvard-the-university-of-melbourne.csl]\n\n\nbibliography: references.bib\ncsl: \"harvard-the-university-of-melbourne.csl\"\n\n\n\nAnd I updated the locations of the images:\n\nOld image locationNew image location\n\n\n![](/img/confirmation-report/system-overview.png)\n\n\n![](system-overview.png)\n\n\n\n\n\nSetting preview images\nIf your blog post has images in it, the default setting is to pick an image to use as a preview on your main blog page. You can specify which image you want to be used as the preview using in the post’s YAML:\nimage: \"talk.png\"\nIf you don’t want any images displayed, set the option to be false:\nimage: false\nIf you don’t have any images in your blog post but you still specify image: false, Quarto will crash when trying to render your website. I had a few moments of madness figuring this out!"

    "text": "Modifying the home page layout\nI liked the home page layout of the academic theme so I wanted to replicate it somewhat. There were a few things that needed to be changed, including the social buttons and the profile picture. If you haven’t already created a custom.scss file, go ahead and create one (see the Quarto documentation), as we’ll need it for this section.\nNext, in _quarto.yml, add the following:\ntheme: custom.scss\nWhich tells Quarto to use your custom styles.\n\nTinkering with your picture\nRefer to the Quarto About Page documentation for more templates, but the trestles template was the one that gave me Hugo Academic vibes. To use this template, add the following to your site’s index.qmd:\nimage: \"img/ben.jpg\"\nabout:\n  template: trestles\n  image-shape: round\n  image-alt: \"A portrait photo of Ben, they've got their hair up in a bun, are wearing a white and navy striped jumper, and are smiling.\"\nThe image argument points to the profile picture you want to use. The main problem with the image in the trestles template is in mobile view - it touches the navigation bar at the top and I don’t like that. To fix it, add the following to your custom.scss file:\n.about-image {\n  margin-top: 20px;\n  width: 15rem !important;\n  height: 15rem !important;\n}\nThe margin-top is the argument that stops the image and navbar from touching, the width and height arguments are personal preference. I find in mobile the default size of the image is so large that it bumps the start of the ‘About me’ text off-screen. By making the image slightly smaller, a couple of lines of text are visible and we hopefully entice people to read more!\n\n\nSocial buttons\nThe default layout of the social links in the Quarto blog (see the About Page documentation) is to create rectangular buttons. This isn’t the worst, but I like the look of just using the company logos. The other downside of the Quarto default is that in mobile view it looks shit, the buttons are arranged vertically and take up the whole screen. That means if you have a lot of links people have to scroll past them to find out more about you.\n\nIncluding extra icons\nTo get the buttons looking like they do on my home page we need to include the fontawesome extension and add some custom styling. The fontawesome extension is needed for a couple of icons which aren’t included in the default Bootstrap pack. To install the extension, run:\nquarto add quarto-ext/fontawesome\nfrom the RStudio terminal. Then add the links like you would according to the About Page documentation. The Font Awesome icons are included as follows:\nlinks:\n    - text: \"{{&lt; fa brands bluesky &gt;}}\"\n      href: https://bsky.app/profile/bharrap.bsky.social\nThe Font Awesome website has a list of all available icons (https://fontawesome.com/search), just make sure you tick the ‘Free’ filter.\n\n\nChanging the icon orientation\nAdd the following three styles to your custom.scss file:\n.about-link-text {\n  font-size: 2rem;\n}\nThis increases the size of the icons, they look comically small otherwise. Make it larger if you like.\n.about-link {\n  border: none !important;\n}\nThis removes the rounded border from the icons. It’s ugly and we don’t need it.\n.about-links {\n  flex-direction: row !important;\n}\nThis is the most important bit. This changes the orientation of the icons to be in a row, rather than a column, when viewing the website in a narrow window (e.g. on mobile or a small browser window)."

    "section": "Other bits",
    "text": "Other bits\nThere were a couple of other bits that I found annoying to do but weren’t directly related to replicating the Hugo Academic theme, so I’ve included them here.\n\nChanging fonts\nThere seem to be a few ways to change fonts in Quarto but only the following way worked for me - in particular for the monospaced font. I like Nunito for regular text and Noto Sans Mono for monospaced text. To change the font, head over to Google Fonts and find the fonts you like.\nWhen you find the fonts you like click on the ‘Get font’ button, then ‘&lt;&gt; Get embed code’, then copy the third &lt;link&gt; tag from the HTML &lt;head&gt; code. Paste that tag into _quarto.yml as follows:\nformat:\n  html:\n    theme: custom.scss\n    header-includes: |\n      &lt;link href=https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Noto+Sans+Mono:wght@100..900&family=Nunito:ital,wght@0,200..1000;1,200..1000&display=swap rel=\"stylesheet\"&gt;\nNext, add the following to the scss:defaults section of your custom.scss file:\n/*-- scss:defaults --*/\n\n$web-font-path: \"Break\";\n$font-family-sans-serif: \"Nunito\", sans-serif !default;\n$font-family-monospace: \"Noto Sans Mono\", monospace !default;\nThe reason for the $web-font-path argument is that I couldn’t figure out how to override the default monospace font being used until I came across this handy Stack Overflow answer. The following two arguments just set the fonts for your sans-serif and monospace text.\n\n\nAdding the ‘Buy me a coffee’ widget\nCailin, my first coffee supporter, very generously offered to buy me a coffee as thanks for the RStudio themes I made, which prompted me to create a Buy me a coffee account. Then I needed to add the widget to my website, which is a pretty simple task.\nFirst, create an account if you don’t already have one, then find your way to ‘Website widget’ in the ‘Buttons & Graphics’ menu. Once you’ve create the button, copy the script.\nNext, paste it in to your _quarto.yml file in the header-includes argument. Building on our example before where we already included the Google Font link, we paste the Buy me a coffee script on a new line with the same indentation as the link.\nformat:\n  html:\n    header-includes: |\n      &lt;link href=https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Noto+Sans+Mono:wght@100..900&family=Nunito:ital,wght@0,200..1000;1,200..1000&family=Source+Sans+3:ital,wght@0,200..900;1,200..900&display=swap rel=\"stylesheet\"&gt;\n      &lt;script data-name=\"BMC-Widget\" data-cfasync=\"false\" src=\"https://cdnjs.buymeacoffee.com/1.0.0/widget.prod.min.js\" data-id=\"benharrap\" data-description=\"Support me on Buy me a coffee!\" data-message=\"\" data-color=\"#ffddd6\" data-position=\"Right\" data-x_margin=\"18\" data-y_margin=\"18\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\nTo change the colour of the widget, update the hex code in the data-color argument. If you entered a widget message when you generated it, there will be text in the data-message argument. Personally I would recommend turning this off as it is pops up every single time a new page is loaded and gets very annoying very quickly. If you leave the argument blank (i.e. data-message=\"\") the button sits there quietly.\nThat’s all my advice for now - and hey if you found it useful, why not buy me a coffee!"

    "text": "People can have multiple pronouns or pronouns that change over time, like myself. In an ideal world, I’d love it if people used a random pronoun each time, but people aren’t random number generators and when presented with “any pronouns” will usually default to exclusively “he”.\nThis got me thinking though… What if I could randomly sample from a list of pronouns? So that’s what I’ve done — for Quarto users at least. It’s simple really, all you need to do is define each person’s pronouns:\n\nben &lt;- list(name = \"ben\",\n            subject = c(\"he\",\"she\",\"they\"),\n            object = c(\"him\",\"her\",\"their\"),\n            dependent = c(\"his\",\"her\",\"their\"),\n            independent = c(\"his\",\"hers\",\"theirs\"),\n            reflextive = c(\"himself\",\"herself\",\"themself\"))\n\nI have to thank Wikipedia for providing the names of the different pronoun forms, it’s been a couple of decades since I had to think about this. Now we can just write a little function that samples from this list and returns the appropriate pronoun, in the format required.\n\npronoun &lt;- function(who, which, format = \"lower\"){\n  if (format == \"title\") {\n  gsub(\"(\\\\w)(\\\\w*)\", \"\\\\U\\\\1\\\\L\\\\2\", sample(who[[which]],1), perl=TRUE)\n  } else {\n    sample(who[[which]],1)\n  }\n}\n\npronoun(ben,\"subject\",\"title\")\n\n[1] \"They\"\n\n\nTo use this, you would just call the function in-text like you would any R function. I was very satisfied getting to this point (and figuring out how to do it in base R), but then I realised that English is a very annoying language. The particularly annoying part is that because any of he, she, and they could be picked, it’s hard to know what the right verb to choose is. To illustrate:\npronoun(ben,\"subject\",\"title\") likes greyhounds\nIs returned as:\nHe likes greyhounds\nIn my Quarto file I have no idea which pronoun is going to get picked (yay!) but depending on which one gets picked, I should’ve used ‘like’ or ‘likes’.\nWell that’s a future me problem, this was just a fun little proof of concept. If I come back around to this, maybe I’ll:\n\nExtend the function to cover verbs\nIntegrate it with YAML somehow? It’d be cool to attach pronouns to author YAML and turn the function into a Quarto extension"

If you want to do any other operations, c_across() is your friend!\n\n\nSet values to missing under a condition (na_if())\nI would normally use case_when() to set observations to missing when they meet particular conditions, but na_if() seems like a more direct way of doing that:\n\nk5 &lt;- k5 |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    k5_score = na_if(k5_score, 13)\n  )\nk5\n\n# A tibble: 4 × 7\n     id    q1    q2    q3    q4    q5 k5_score\n  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1     1     5     5     3     3     3       19\n2     2     3     1     2     1     5       12\n3     3     1     2     3     1     2        9\n4     4     2     1     5     1     4       NA\n\n\n\n\nifelse but tidyverse style (if_else())\nI would normally have used case_when() in this case too, as I find it easier read what’s happening in each condition, but occasionally I find myself using ifelse for convenience when I only need to use one condition.\nif_else() just seems like a better version of ifelse(). The main appeal is the inclusion of the missing argument, which lets you specify what you want missing values to be coded as:\n\nk5 |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    k5_category = if_else(k5_score &lt; 12, \"low\",\"high\", missing = \"missing\")\n  )\n\n# A tibble: 4 × 8\n     id    q1    q2    q3    q4    q5 k5_score k5_category\n  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;      \n1     1     5     5     3     3     3       19 high       \n2     2     3     1     2     1     5       12 high       \n3     3     1     2     3     1     2        9 low        \n4     4     2     1     5     1     4       NA missing    \n\n\n\n\nUsing another dataset to update rows (rows_update())\nThis was a great recommendation by someone who helped me solve a problem efficiently. I had one dataset consisting of uncleaned responses to a paper questionnaire, which had been digitsed using OCR. I had a secondary dataset where the original paper questionnaire had been audited when the OCR seemed to have done a poor job.\nSticking with the K-5 data, imagine we have the audited data as follows:\n\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 4\n     id variable original audited\n  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;\n1     3 q1              2       1\n2     3 q2              4       5\n\n\nAll I had to do was use pivot_longer() to put the uncleaned data into long format and then use rows_update() to find and replace the corresponding values, then pivot_wider() back into the original format.\n\nk5 |&gt; \n  pivot_longer(\n    !id,\n    names_to = \"variable\",\n    values_to = \"response\"\n    ) |&gt;\n  rows_update(\n    audit |&gt; \n      rename(response = audited) |&gt; \n      select(id, variable, response),\n    by = c(\"id\",\"variable\")\n  ) |&gt; \n  pivot_wider(\n    names_from = \"variable\",\n    values_from = \"response\"\n  )\n\n# A tibble: 4 × 7\n     id    q1    q2    q3    q4    q5 k5_score\n  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1     1     5     5     3     3     3       19\n2     2     3     1     2     1     5       12\n3     3     1     5     3     1     2        9\n4     4     2     1     5     1     4       NA\n\n\nNote that inside of rows_update() I take audit, rename the column with the correct values to match the column name in the data, then keep only the columns used to identify the unique rows (id and variable) and the value used for updating (response).\nThere’s a whole suite of row-specific functions (see here), but I have found rows_update() being especially helpful.\n\n\nAdding rows to a dataset (bind_rows())\nI feel like everyone probably knows about this, but I wanted to quickly mention that I recently discovered I was using it inefficiently! bind_rows() accepts multiple things to be bound, meaning you can write:\n\ndf1 |&gt; bind_rows(df2, df3, df4)\n\nInstead of what I was previously doing:\n\ndf1 |&gt; \n  bind_rows(df2) |&gt; \n  bind_rows(df3) |&gt; \n  bind_rows(df4)"

I’d do this by combining the output from tabyl() and summarise() into one data frame. For example:\n\nsummary &lt;- k5 |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    n = n(),\n    mean = mean(q1),\n    sd = sd(q1),\n    min = min(q1),\n    max = max(q1)\n  ) |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(everything())\n\nsummary\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 2\n  name  value\n  &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 n      4   \n2 mean   2.75\n3 sd     1.71\n4 min    1   \n5 max    5   \n\n\nBut the number of participants is different to summaries of responses to Q1, so I want to add a row to make this clear. This is easily done by using the .before = argument:\n\nsummary |&gt; \n  add_row(\n    name = \"Q1 responses\",\n    .before = 2\n  )\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 2\n  name         value\n  &lt;chr&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 n             4   \n2 Q1 responses NA   \n3 mean          2.75\n4 sd            1.71\n5 min           1   \n6 max           5   \n\n\n\n\nConverting lists to tibbles (enframe())\nI’ve been doing a lot of work with APIs and getting data returned as JSON, which the httr2 package helpfully converts into a more usable format in R. Unfortunately, what I get tends to be a lot of nested lists that I need to combine together into a rectangular format.\n\nmy_list &lt;- c(\"Victoria\",\"Western Australia\",\"Tasmania\")\n\nmy_list\n\n[1] \"Victoria\"          \"Western Australia\" \"Tasmania\"         \n\n\nEnter enframe(). It works with vectors and converts them into a tibble with two columns. Very simple, very useful.\n\nenframe(my_list)\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 2\n   name value            \n  &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt;            \n1     1 Victoria         \n2     2 Western Australia\n3     3 Tasmania"

In the questionnaire, section headers are used to paginate the different sections, but in the metadata the header is attached to a single variable:\n\ndictionary &lt;- tibble(\n  variable = c(\"name\",\"dob\",\"q1\",\"q2\",\"q3\",\"q4\",\"q5\"),\n  header = c(\"About you\",NA,\"Psychological distress\",NA,NA,NA,NA)\n)\n\ndictionary\n\n# A tibble: 7 × 2\n  variable header                \n  &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;chr&gt;                 \n1 name     About you             \n2 dob      &lt;NA&gt;                  \n3 q1       Psychological distress\n4 q2       &lt;NA&gt;                  \n5 q3       &lt;NA&gt;                  \n6 q4       &lt;NA&gt;                  \n7 q5       &lt;NA&gt;                  \n\n\nWhen creating the data dictionary, I want the header to be present for every variable as it can be useful to identify or analyse data by section:\n\ndictionary |&gt; \n  fill(header, .direction = \"down\")\n\n# A tibble: 7 × 2\n  variable header                \n  &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;chr&gt;                 \n1 name     About you             \n2 dob      About you             \n3 q1       Psychological distress\n4 q2       Psychological distress\n5 q3       Psychological distress\n6 q4       Psychological distress\n7 q5       Psychological distress\n\n\nThe .direction argument accepts “down”, “up”, “downup”, and “updown”, meaning you can fill in multiple directions. This is especially powerful when you combine it with group_by(), allowing you to fill without worrying about propagating into the wrong group."

    "title": "Switching from Stata to R",
    "section": "Workflow differences",
    "text": "Workflow differences\nI’ll briefly outline some important things to know when switching from Stata to R, because while R can do everything Stata can do, it goes about it differently.\n\nPackages\nPackages are the reason that R is such a powerful tool. Packages can be thought of as a collection of functions, typically centered around a particular theme or method. Base R is refers to the functions included by default when you install R on your machine. The main thing to know with R packages is that if you can imagine a function, someone’s probably already written a package for it.\nI personally find that base R code can be quite arcane to read, which is why I’m such a tidyverse fan. The tidyverse is a collection of packages that is incredibly popular and for good reason; the design of the packages share consistent philosophy around how code should be written (see their website if you want to learn more).\nTo install R packages just run install.packages(\"&lt;package name&gt;\"). To use the package, run library(&lt;package name&gt;) to load in all the functions from that package into your current R session.\nYou can also use specific functions from packages by loading the functions in specifically (using include.only), or by explicitly calling the function without loading the package (using ::), demonstrated in the example below.\n\nLoad specific functionCall function without loading\n\n\nlibrary(haven, include.only = \"read_dta\")\nauto &lt;- read_dta(\"/Applications/Stata/auto.dta\")\n\n\nauto &lt;- haven::read_dta(\"/Applications/Stata/auto.dta\")\n\n\n\n\n\nMultiple datasets\nStata can sort of do this but nothing like how R does. Instead of using frame to create and manage multiple in-memory datasets and frame change to switch between datasets, you can just load multiple datasets into R, assign them names, and simply call these names when going about your work, no explicit switching required. I won’t go into detail here as you’ll very quickly figure this out as you start to use R, but I think it’s one of the greatest advantages of R over Stata.\n\n\nPipes\nUsing the auto dataset as an example, say we wanted to create a dataset of only domestic cars and analyse their weight to length ratio by brand. In Stata, each line of your code would be executed sequentially and independently with the results window returning something after each step:\nsysuse auto\ndrop if foreign == 1\ngen wgt_len_ratio = weight/length\ngen brand = substr(make, 1, ustrpos(make, \" \")-1)\nsort brand\nby brand: summarize wgt_len_ratio\nYou can write R code in this fashion too but there’s something nice about using pipes. You can think of pipes as literal pipes, you put something in at one end of the pipe and something comes out the other end. In our case, data goes in one end, your code is what happens inside of the pipe, and the result of your code is what comes out the other end. In R there’s two different pipes, the base pipe |&gt; and the magrittr pipe %&gt;%. You probably don’t need to worry about the difference for now, but for those interested see this post on the tidyverse website.\nThe same operation as above in R could be done as:\nauto &lt;- haven::read_dta(\"/Applications/Stata/auto.dta\")\n\nauto |&gt; \n  filter(foreign == 0) |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    wgt_len_ratio = weight/length,\n    brand = str_extract(make, \"\\\\w+\")\n    ) |&gt; \n  group_by(brand) |&gt; \n  summarise(\n    n = n(),\n    mean = mean(wgt_len_ratio),\n    sd = sd(wgt_len_ratio),\n    min = min(wgt_len_ratio),\n    max = max(wgt_len_ratio)\n  )\nIt’s a little longer in length than the Stata example, however I find pipes and tidyverse in particular make the code more readable and easier to follow and navigate (the indentations also help). The auto dataset goes in to the start of the pipe, we perform some operations to it, and the output of the pipe is the summary we wanted.\n\n\nAssigning output\nOne of the main things to adjust to in R is the need to assign your output. In Stata, if you were to create a new variable, you would just write gen new_var = old_var*2 and it would automatically create new_var in the current dataset. Similarly, if you run a regression model, Stata stores a bunch of information in the background that you can access, such as via the lincom and margins functions.\nIn R, the default is to display the output of your code in the console (similar to Stata’s results window). So if you were to run auto |&gt; mutate(new_var = 1) it would just print the result in the console. Instead, you need to assign the output using the assignment operator &lt;- to an object, either an existing or a new one. For example:\n\nauto &lt;- auto |&gt; mutate(new_var = 1) writes over the object named auto, which is our dataset\nauto_new &lt;- auto |&gt; mutate(new_var = 1) creates a new object called auto_new and leaves the original auto object unchanged\n\nIn the example where we calculated summary statistics by car brand, if you were to run the R code it would simply output the summary statistics in the console. If you wanted to do something with the summary statistics later, you would assign the output.\nOne aspect of this feature is that it completely circumvents the need for Stata’s preserve and restore. Just assign the output of your code to a new object where you would instead have used preserve and restore. This makes it handy for analyses of data at different stages of cleaning or analysis.\n\n\nFurther resources\nThe resources I would recommend for learning more R are:\n\nR for Data Science\nAdvanced R\nggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis\nFundamentals of Data Visualization\n\nNote that Fundamentals of Data Visualization doesn’t include the R code by default. Instead, Claus provides a link on the welcome page to the book’s GitHub repo, which you can search through to find the code to replicate the graphs in the book."

Yeah R doesn’t do that\n\n\nCreate a variable using conditions\ngen price_10k = 0 then replace price_10k = 1 if price &gt;=10000\nmutate(price_10k = case_when(price &gt;= 10000 ~ 1, .default = 0))\ncase_when() can be used for many of the functions in egen too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther basics\nThese functions are more about performing other operations to datasets than changing or modifying variables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFunction\nStata\nR\nNote\n\n\n\n\nRenaming variables\nrename weight weight_lbs\nrename(weight_lbs weight)\nThe arguments are back to front in R. Stata is &lt;current name&gt; &lt;new name&gt;, dplyr is &lt;new name&gt; &lt;current name&gt;\n\n\nDropping variables\ndrop mpg\nselect(-mpg)\nThe minus is what drops the variable. Without the minus it would instead keep only mpg\n\n\nDropping observations\ndrop if foreign == 1\nfilter(foreign != 1)\nFilter keeps observations that meet criteria, rather than drops them, hence the inverse condition\n\n\nReshaping wider\nreshape wide mpg, i(make) j(turn)\npivot_wider(names_from = ‘turn’, values_from = ‘mpg’)\n \n\n\nReshaping longer\nreshape long rep, i(make) j(newvar)\npivot_longer(c(rep78,rep79), values_to = ‘newvar’)\nTo run this example, first create rep79, which I created as rep78+1\n\n\nSummarising data\nsummarize mpg\nsummarise(obs = n(mpg), mean = mean(mpg), stddev = sd(mpg), min = min(mpg), max = max(mpg)\ndplyr treats summarise and summarize as synonyms, so use whichever you prefer.\n\n\nGrouping operations\nby foreign:\ngroup_by(foreign)\nYou would use group_by() in the line before the operation that you want to apply the grouping to. Once you no longer need the grouping to be in place, use ungroup(), otherwise all subsequent operations will be grouped\n\n\nSeed setting\nset seed 1234\nset.seed(1234)\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegression\nThe correspondences here represent the models that you need to run to generate (usually) the same results, not the code that will produce the same output. If you simply run the R code it will output something minimal, instead you will want to assign the model to an object. For the linear regression example, this would be model &lt;- lm(price ~ mpg, data = auto) followed by using the summary function on that object summary(model).\nI say ‘usually’ the same results because for some methods there seems to be some minor difference under the hood that means estimates differ slightly. For example, in the negative binomial example the standard errors for mpg are different at the 4th decimal. Always check your outputs :)\nFinally, I only include some basic regression models here. In epidemiology we often need to deal with observations that aren’t independent, such as in longitudinal studies. Methods such as generalised estimating equations (GEEs) and mixed effects models are supported in R. For GEEs, see the gee package (link). For mixed effects models, the lme4 (link) is popular.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModel\nStata\nR\nNote\n\n\n\n\nSimple linear regression\nreg price mpg\nlm(price ~ mpg, data = auto)\n \n\n\nLogistic regression\nlogit foreign mpg\nglm(foreign ~ mpg, data = auto, family = \"binomial\")\n \n\n\nPoisson regression\npoisson rep78 mpg\nglm(rep78 ~ mpg, data = auto, family = \"poisson\")\n \n\n\nNegative binomial regression\nnbreg displacement mpg\nMASS::glm.nb(displacement ~ mpg, data = auto)\nRequires the MASS package"

Children placed in out-of-home care between 2000 and 2019 were matched to children never placed and prevalence and cumulative incidence estimates of mental and neurodevelopmental health conditions were compared.\nResults\nChildren placed in out-of-home care had a three times greater prevalence of mental and neurodevelopmental health conditions generally. The prevalence of foetal alcohol spectrum disorder was ten times higher, and post-traumatic stress disorder was seven times higher for those placed in out-of-home care. Cumulative incidence plots highlighted for different conditions the ages at which the rate of diagnosis diverges between the two groups.\nConclusions\nChildren placed in out-of-home care had greater mental and neurodevelopmental health needs generally when compared to children never placed in out-of-home care.\nImplications for Public Health\nChild protective services must ensure culturally safe, comprehensive, wrap-around services for Aboriginal children and their families are provided. Approaches should build on the strength of children, families and culture and avoid stigmatising children and their parents."

This study utilised linked administrative data to determine the longitudinal child protection pathways from birth to age 10 years for a cohort of 15,815 Aboriginal children born in Western Australia between 2000 and 2006. In total, 9,269 (59%) children did not have any contact with child protection between one year prior to birth and their 11th birthday. Conversely, 6,546 (41%) Aboriginal children were involved with child protection during the study period, with 1,405 (9%) children placed in out-of-home care. Infants who had a child protection notification were more likely than other age groups to have a substantiated notification of abuse and neglect and placed in out-of-home care. More than half (56%) of all children were predominantly placed in kinship care; however, only 22% had their first placement with kinship carers. Aboriginal-led strategies together with the support and commitment of all levels of government are required to reduce entry into care and improve outcomes for Aboriginal children in care."

Among sibling groups where at least one sibling had a CPS contact, approximately half of children had their first contacts on the same date as another sibling. For children born after one of their siblings had been placed in out-of-home care, 31.9 % had themselves been placed in out-of-home care by age one.\nConclusions\nMultiple children tend to be placed into out-of-home care when at least one sibling is, which is likely to have a significant impact on families affected. The additional risk of placement also carries over to children born after the first removal in a sibling group, highlighting the need for further support to prevent future removals."

    "text": "A randomised controlled trial of email versus mailed invitation letter in a national longitudinal survey of physicians\nBenjamin Harrap, Tamara Taylor, Grant Russell, Anthony Scott PLoS OneLink to article\n\n\nClick for abstract\n\n Despite their low cost, the use of email invitations to distribute surveys to medical practitioners have been associated with lower response rates. This research compares the difference in response rates from using email approach plus online completion rather than a mailed invitation letter plus a choice of online or paper completion. A parallel randomised controlled trial was conducted during the 11th annual wave of the nationally representative Medicine in Australia: Balancing Employment and Life (MABEL) longitudinal survey of doctors. The control group was invited using a mailed paper letter (including a paper survey plus instructions to complete online) and three mailed paper reminders. The intervention group was approached in the same way apart from the second reminder when they were approached by email only. The primary outcome is the response rate and the statistical analysis was blinded. 18,247 doctors were randomly allocated to the control (9,125) or intervention group (9,127), with 9,108 and 9,107 included in the analysis. Using intention to treat analysis, the response rate in the intervention group was 35.92% compared to 37.59% in the control group, a difference of -1.66 percentage points (95% CI: -3.06 to -0.26). The difference was larger for General Practitioners (-2.76 percentage points, 95% CI: -4.65 to -0.87) compared to other specialists (-0.47 percentage points, 95% CI: -2.53 to 1.60). For those who supplied an email address, the average treatment effect on the treated was higher at -2.63 percentage points (95% CI: -4.50 to -0.75) for all physicians, -3.17 percentage points (95% CI: -5.83 to -0.53) for General Practitioners, and -2.1 percentage points (95% CI: -4.75 to 0.56) for other specialists. For qualified physicians, using email to invite participants to complete a survey leads to lower response rates compared to a mailed letter. Lower response rates need to be traded off with the lower costs of using email rather than mailed letters."

Three HPs participated in three half-day online workshops and applied their learnings during training cases (maximum four). Competency was assessed with a validated tool and achieved ‘satisfactory’ ratings for three consecutive sessions. LISTEN pilot. A single-group, pre-post study (up to four LISTEN sessions) with online assessments at baseline, post-intervention, and 4-week follow-up. Eligible participants were adults with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, with diabetes distress, but excluded if they had moderate/severe depressive and/or anxiety symptoms. Feasibility was assessed via recruitment and session completion rates. Acceptability was assessed with post-intervention self-report data. Changes in diabetes distress and general emotional well-being from baseline (T1) were explored at post-intervention (T2) and at 4-week follow-up (T3).\nResults\nTwo HPs achieved competency (median training case sessions required: 7) and progressed to deliver LISTEN in the pilot study. In the pilot, N = 16 adults (Med [IQR] age: 60 [37–73] years; 13 women) with diabetes participated (median sessions per participant: 2). Twelve participants (75%) completed the post-intervention assessment (T2): 92% endorsed the number of sessions offered as ‘just right’, 75% felt comfortable talking with the HP, and 67% were satisfied with LISTEN. Perceived limitations were the structured format and narrow scope of problems addressed. Diabetes distress scores were lower post-intervention.\nConclusions\nThis pilot demonstrates the feasibility of training HPs to deliver LISTEN, and the acceptability and potential benefits of LISTEN for adults with diabetes. The findings highlight adaptations that may enhance the delivery of, and satisfaction with, LISTEN that will be tested in a hybrid type 1 effectiveness-implementation trial."

Eighty-seven percent of respondents were current members and 56% did not consider themselves as coming from an under-represented background. The majority of respondents, regardless of background, considered the SSA to be an inclusive and welcoming organisation, however for those from an under-represented background only half always felt welcome at SSA-run events. Responses to the open-ended questions generated discussion among the EDI Committee and broader Executive Committee, which has resulted in the work being done to address how the SSA recruits members to join its councils, what topics the SSA should make public statements on, and making information on the organisational structure of the SSA more easily accessible to new members."

This article assesses the development and outcomes of their permanent migration programmes for a range of regulated professions. We compare the matched census data from both countries in 2016 and then examine the key drivers of the major differences found through qualitative interviews. Although the trends in numbers and source countries and characteristics of skilled migrants are similar, their earnings relative to equivalent native-born earnings are far lower in Canada than in Australia. This reflects the Australian government’s greater power to initiate and drive policy reform agendas, early strategies designed to enhance foreign credential recognition and a heightened role for employers including through two-step migration. Canada has recently announced significantly expanded migration intakes. These seem unlikely to lead to strong economic growth, unless entry requirements are tightened and more targeted support provided."

This significantly increases risks to both mother and child. A major contributor to both prepregnancy obesity and excessive GWG is physical inactivity; however, past interventions targeting maternal weight gain and activity levels during the antenatal period have been ineffective in women who are already overweight. Pedometer-guided activity may offer a novel solution for increasing activity levels in this population.\nObjective\nThis initial feasibility randomized controlled trial aimed to test a pedometer-based intervention to increase activity and reduce excessive GWG in pregnant women.\nMethods\nWe supplied 30 pregnant women with obesity a Fitbit Zip pedometer and randomized them into 1 of 3 groups: control (pedometer only), app (pedometer synced to patients’ personal smartphone, with self-monitoring of activity), or app-coach (addition of a health coach–delivered behavioral change program). Feasibility outcomes included participant compliance with wearing pedometers (days with missing pedometer data), data syncing, and data integrity. Activity outcomes (step counts and active minutes) were analyzed using linear mixed models and generalized estimating equations.\nResults\nA total of 30 participants were recruited within a 10-week period, with a dropout rate of 10% (3/30; 2 withdrawals and 1 stillbirth); 27 participants thus completed the study. Mean BMI in all groups was ≥35 kg/m2. Mean (SD) percentage of missing data days were 23.4% (20.6%), 39.5% (32.4%), and 21.1% (16.0%) in control, app group, and app-coach group patients, respectively. Estimated mean baseline activity levels were 14.5 active min/day and 5455 steps/day, with no significant differences found in activity levels between groups, with mean daily step counts in all groups remaining in the sedentary (5000 steps/day) or low activity (5000-7499 steps/day) categories for the entire study duration. There was a mean decrease of 7.8 steps/day for each increase in gestation day over the study period (95% CI 2.91 to 12.69, P=.002).\nConclusions\nActivity data syncing with a personal smartphone is feasible in a cohort of pregnant women with obesity. However, our results do not support a future definitive study in its present form. Recruitment and retention rates were adequate, as was activity data syncing to participants’ smartphones. A follow-up interventional trial seeking to reduce GWG and improve activity in this population must focus on improving compliance with activity data recording and behavioral interventions delivered."

Yet it is not known whether these findings are applicable to Australia’s unique geography. This study aimed to determine whether the incidence of first episode psychosis (FEP) varies according to neighbourhood characteristics in an Australian cohort.\nMethod\nThis study included all young people, aged 15 to 24, with an FEP who attended Orygen Youth Health in Melbourne, from a geographically defined catchment area encompassing Northern and Western Melbourne, over a 44-month period. Neighbourhood demographic data was collected from the 2011 Australian National Census. Negative binomial regression was used to determine incidence rate ratios controlled for age, sex and migrant status.\nResults\nA total of 747 young people had an FEP during the 44-month study period and 722 were included in this study. Of these, 58.0% were males and 67.9% had a non-affective psychotic disorder; the mean age of the cohort was 19.1 years. The incidence of FEP in young people aged 15 to 24 in the catchment area was 123.2 per 100,000 person-years. There was a higher incidence of FEP in neighbourhoods of greatest social deprivation (IRR = 1.65, CI = 1.06–2.51, p = .02), highest unemployment (IRR = 1.56, CI = 1.04–2.35, p = .03) and above average social fragmentation (IRR = 1.42, CI = 1.02–1.97, p = .04), when controlled for age, sex and migrant status.\nConclusions\nThis study highlights variation in psychotic disorder incidence and the need for this disparity to be reflected in appropriate resource allocation."
