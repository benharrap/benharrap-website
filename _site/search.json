At the end of the day, I want to contribute to research that ends up improving the lives of others.\nI also think it’s important that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are leading the research agenda, my place as a non-Indigenous person is to listen, collaborate, and support that agenda as best I can with the skills that I have."

    "text": "Being broke(?)\nBack in 2018 I finished my master’s degree in biostatistics and proceeded to work in various roles applying my statistics and data skills. These were predominantly academic positions, and being employed by an Australian university meant my salary was tied to very specific pay bands. I was happy to be working full-time, having been working weekends and studying full-time for the last year and a half. Going from working a minimum-wage casual retail job to earning a full-time Level A wage felt good by comparison.\nI’d wanted to do a PhD for a long time, but now that I was earning a full-time wage my partner and I were able to work toward financial goals. The prospect of being a broke PhD student was not appealing. This didn’t have to be the case though, as I found out after I chatted to a friend of mine who suggested working a couple of days in addition to doing a PhD. I ran the numbers and he was right, if I was able to secure a PhD scholarship (~$30,000 a year tax-free at the time) and work two days a week, my net income was almost the same as my current full-time income as a research assistant.\nWith this in mind, I figured I may as well do a PhD. Graduate researchers are a source of cheap labour and the work would be similar to what I was currently doing. And since the money was practically the same, why not spend the next 3 to 4 years doing the same work and earning the same money, but ending up with a PhD and in turn increasing my earning potential? Well it turns out the work wasn’t the same as being a research assistant (there is a LOT more independence), but the pay was at least the same.\nAt the time however, I wasn’t passionate about any area in particular. I just really enjoyed coding and was agnostic to the context that I was doing it. So how does that turn into a PhD?"

    "text": "Passion vs. job\nI’ve come to the realisation that PhDs tend to fall into one of two categories. You either start a PhD because you’re passionate about something, or you see it as a job that’s a stepping stone to further your career. I was certainly in the latter category initially, however my passion for my topic developed over the course of my PhD.\nSince I didn’t know what I wanted to do, I looked for projects being advertised that were suited to my skills in an area that I thought was interesting. I happened across an advert on the Statistical Society of Australia’s job forum. I saw an advert for a quantitative PhD student to do research into the health outcomes of Aboriginal children in out-of-home care using linked administrative data. I’ve always wanted the work I do to have meaning, be helpful, and ‘do good’ and this project ticked all of those boxes.\nDespite my developing passion for the topic, I still treated my PhD like a job. Besides the last 3 months of ‘crunch’, I never worked evenings or weekends. I worked 9 to 5, five days a week - three being on my PhD and two being in my job. The advent of covid and remote working was a boon, because it meant I could be a lot more flexible with my time. Some weeks I might work 5 days on my PhD and make up work days at a later date - as long as the work got done nobody minded."

The timeframe of a PhD and the environment of learning is unique, so make the most of your time and learn and don’t forget that you’re a PhD student. I learned an enormous amount over the course of my PhD that was ancillary to it.\nI could have stuck with Stata and written my thesis in MS Word, but I wanted to learn R so I committed to doing as much as possible in R and RMarkdown. I could have used statistical methods I had used before, but where possible I made sure to implement methods I hadn’t. Try and build opportunities to learn extra skills into your research.\nAlso take every opportunity you can to apply for funding to attend conferences, workshops, etc. When you’re a student, fees are generally a lot lower, so any funding you can get goes a lot further. If you’re in the statistics field in Australia, make sure you join the Statistical Society of Australia - the financial support offered to students far surpasses the cost of membership."

    "title": "Reflecting on my PhD experience",
    "section": "Things that were difficult",
    "text": "Things that were difficult\nThere are many difficult parts to doing a PhD, which are usually difficult because you’ve never done them before. I think it’s useful to remember that if something is difficult it probably means you’re learning, and that’s a good thing. Realising this doesn’t make it any less difficult mind you.\n\nWorking on the same thing, for a long time\nThe most difficult part of the PhD for me was completing my first research article. My assessment at the start was that the code would only take a couple of weeks to write, the write-up might take another month, so budgeting three months to have my first draft ready was being generous. In reality, two years passed between the first meeting to discuss the aims of the article and when it was finally published.\nMy expectations for how long the process would take didn’t improve either. For the next article, I still thought three months was a reasonable timeframe. It took nine months from start to submission. The third article took five months from start to submission. With practice and experience, I’ve certainly became more efficient with my time, but I’m still terrible at estimating how long something will take.\nFor the longest time, the disconnection between my expectation of how long it should take and how long it was actually taking made me feel very stupid. This feeling of stupidity also turned into resentment at times - I didn’t want to get feedback from data custodians, I didn’t want reviewer comments, I just wanted the research to be done.\n\n\nDealing with feedback\nI’ve gotten much better at separating myself from my work, in that I don’t see feedback as a criticism of who I am, I see it as an opportunity to improve my work. I do still feel a whole host of emotions when I receive feedback, because after all I thought the work was good enough to submit for review. My advice for managing feedback is to read the feedback during work hours, but only read it. Do not respond to it, just let your mind dwell on it and return to it the next day. This lets you feel whatever emotions you’re going to feel on your initial reading of the feedback and by sleeping on it you’ll return to it with a clearer mind and give more measured responses.\n\n\nMotivation\nI struggled a LOT with motivation. It felt like days or weeks would go by and I hadn’t done anything at all. Then I’d have periods of enormous productivity. Unfortunately, being extremely productive in a short period of time didn’t alleviate the guilt I experienced during my unproductive periods. I was forever beating myself up for not being able to have productive periods all the time. Being diagnosed with ADHD 8 months before I was due to finish wasn’t ideal, but better late than never I guess.\nDeadlines were a mixed source of motivation. External deadlines were excellent - I’m very good at being accountable to someone else. Things like candidature milestones or submission deadlines were very successful motivators. Setting my own deadlines was not so good, sometimes I’d be able to meet them, but often I’d feel guilty because I wasn’t meeting them - a problem exacerbated by my terrible ability to know how long things should take.\n\n\nMental health\nIf you speak to practically anyone that’s done a PhD, they’ll tell you that their mental health suffered. This was true for me and living in Victoria (Australia) during covid lockdowns certainly didn’t help. I think my perspective on hardship, that feeling like shit is usually temporary, helped carry me through it all though. I’m not suggesting you change your mentality though (“have you tried just not being depressed?”), so here’s some other things that also helped get me through:\n\nMy partner, who supported me in many ways through the whole process\nMy supervisors, who were kind, supportive, and understanding throughout the process\nMy greyhound(s), who love their routines and will not let you skip a walk (getting out of the house was good)\nDoing things that made me happy, which at the time were cooking, brewing beer, gardening, and playing video games\nSeeing a psychologist (do this even if you aren’t doing a PhD)"

To do this I started off making a new ‘Quarto Blog’ project in RStudio following the documentation on Quarto’s website. It’s important to select blog, not website.\nThe very first thing you want to do is swap the YAML between the about.qmd and index.qmd files. This is because the index is the home page for your website. The default is to make the blog your home page, but we don’t want that. Swapping the YAML puts your bio as the home page. I also renamed the posts folder to post, just in case that mattered but I’m not sure it does.\nThe next thing is to rename about.qmd, calling it post.qmd. This is now your main page for your blog and it has the same URL structure as the old Hugo Academic template. This means when you migrate your blog posts from your old to your new website, the URLs won’t break. Yay!"

    "text": "Migrating blog posts\n\nKeeping URLs consistent\nQuarto’s method of organising files used in blog posts is way better than blogdown/Hugo. Instead of having a .Rmd file in the post folder and keeping all the content in a separate location (was it in static? I never remember), you have one folder per blog post and all the files go in that folder. I.e.:\n-   post\n  -   2024-11-25-quarto-migration\n  -   2024-08-10-phd-reflection\n  -   etc.\nThe name of each blog post’s folder will be used to create the URL. This means if you want to keep the URLs of your blog posts the same, you must give each blog post’s folder the same name as the original .Rmd file. To copy the content across, just copy and paste the original .Rmd file and rename it to index.qmd. Note the change in extension from .Rmd to .qmd.\nFor example, my blog post reflecting on my PhD experience was originally written in a file called 2024-08-10-phd-reflection.Rmd. This means I would create a folder within the post folder called 2024-08-10-phd-reflection, put my original blog post file 2024-08-10-phd-reflection.Rmd inside this folder and rename the file to index.qmd. Building on the above example, this would look like:\n-   post\n  -   2024-11-25-quarto-migration\n  -   2024-08-10-phd-reflection\n    -   index.qmd\n  -   etc.\n\n\nTranslating .Rmd to .qmd files\nNow you’ve changed your original .Rmd files to .qmd files by just renaming them, you’ll need to fix some of the YAML.\nThe main thing is to delete tags: []. Quarto only uses categories. Without knowing what other YAML options you were using it’s hard to say what else needs to change but if you try and render your website it will either work or not work, and if it doesn’t work something still needs fixing.\nAn example of the YAML for my PhD reflection blog post is seen below:\n\nOld Rmd YAMLNew qmd YAML\n\n\ntitle: \"Reflecting on my PhD experience\"\nauthor: \"Ben Harrap\"\ndate: 2024-08-10\ncategories: [\"Academic\", \"Self\"]\ntags: [\"Academic\",\"PhD\",\"Research\",\"Learning\"]\n\n\ntitle: \"Reflecting on my PhD experience\"\nauthor: \"Ben Harrap\"\ndate: 2024-08-10\ncategories: \n  -   academia\n  -   self\n  -   phd\n\n\n\n\n\nMoving images, files, etc.\nIf your blog post referenced any files, such as images, you’ll need to move them to the blog post’s folder and update the path in your blog post file. My confirmation report blog post is a good example of this, it uses images, a bibliography, and a .csl file. After moving all the resources to the blog post’s folder, I updated the YAML:\n\nOld Rmd YAMLNew YAML\n\n\nbibliography: [../../static/post/confirmation-report/references.bib]\ncsl: [../../static/post/confirmation-report/harvard-the-university-of-melbourne.csl]\n\n\nbibliography: references.bib\ncsl: \"harvard-the-university-of-melbourne.csl\"\n\n\n\nAnd I updated the locations of the images:\n\nOld image tagNew image tag\n\n\n![](/img/confirmation-report/system-overview.png)\n\n\n![](system-overview.png)\n\n\n\n\n\nSetting preview images\nIf your blog post has images in it, the default setting is to pick an image to use as a preview on your main blog page. You can specify which image you want to be used as the preview using in the post’s YAML:\nimage: \"talk.png\"\nIf you don’t want any images displayed, set the option to be false:\nimage: false\nIf you don’t have any images in your blog post but you still specify image: false, Quarto will crash when trying to render your website. I had a few moments of madness figuring this out!"

    "section": "Justification of research",
    "text": "Justification of research\nBased on my review of the literature there are several aspects of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander child removals and health that need more consideration.\n\nA more detailed analysis of child protection data\nMore up-to-date data is needed to evaluate the state of child removals in Western Australia and the outcomes of government policy over the last decade. The most current research has been based on data covering up to 2010, leaving out over a decade of child removals. The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare published more recent data in their report on child protection (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (2020a)) however it is restricted to a fairly general overview of the state of child protection across Australia. The Family Matters Report 2019 (Lewis et al. 2019) examines child protection data in a little more detail, however this still is not to the level of detail explored in studies such as Bilson et al. (2017) or Jenkins et al. (2018). Examining trends in the data in greater detail can reveal impacts of changes to policy and practice at the departmental or regional level. Having this information available will help inform what policy changes were effective, which may have had unintended consequences, and develop new policy recommendations.\nAnother reason why a more detailed examination of the child protection data is needed is previous analyses have focused on risk factors, rather than taking a strengths-based approach and examining protective factors. The overall goal of the I-CaRe WA study is to identify factors that can help reduce the number of Aboriginal children going into out-of-home care, as well ways of supporting families who are at risk and children who are already in care.\n\n\nThe need to understand the health of children going into care\nIn the qualitative interviews conducted for the I-CaRe WA study, many carers raised the issue that the Department of Communities (the agency responsible for child protection in WA) does not pass on any information about the health of the children. This lack of information creates a barrier for the child and carer to accessing adequate primary healthcare and support services. This puts the children at risk of having health issues result in more severe illness, causing increased burden on the carers as well as the hospital services. Understanding what conditions are common in these children, and breaking it down by geographic region, can help inform healthcare services provided by local Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisations and other support agencies.\nBuilding a health profile of the children in care is also relevant for policymakers for two reasons. Firstly, this can inform service planning and delivery. For example, if children are appearing in hospital data with conditions that should have been managed in a primary care setting this may indicate that the appropriate services are not available or accessible to the families who need them. This can then inform the provision of additional services or outreach programs to help families at risk and prevent their children from ending up in hospital. More outreach is certainly needed, as Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are under-represented in service usage data for services designed to support and prevent entry into the out-of-home care system (Lewis et al. 2019). Secondly, the treatment and management of health conditions has a monetary cost associated with it. Quantifying the number and type of health conditions means the monetary cost of providing this healthcare can be estimated, relevant for budgeting and funding of services.\n\n\nIdentifying protective factors and strengths of Aboriginal culture and practices\nIn addition to understanding the health of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children going into care, it would also be beneficial to identify the strengths of the communities and cultural practices which protect against ill-health and interactions with the child protection system.\nAboriginal culture and practices are important, and Aboriginal ways of being and doing are critical to the principle of self-determination. By identifying strengths of these communities, more localised support can be provided to encourage and enhance these practices.\nThe overall goal of my research is to contribute new knowledge and evidence that can be used to support Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities at risk of child protection involvement and help reduce the rate of children going into care."

    "text": "Child protection in Australia\nAustralia has a history of removing Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children from their families since colonisation, with the Stolen Generations being a very recent reminder of racist colonial practices of assimilation. The history of colonisation and the impact of these practices resulted in intergenerational trauma which is still felt by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and contributes to many challenges they face today, including deficits in parenting skills due to the disruption of families and prevention of passing on of knowledge, and high levels of substance use and mental health issues (Wilson & Wilkie 1997).\nWhile the policies underpinning the Stolen Generations came to an end in the late 1960s, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children continue to be removed from their parents at an alarming rate, as evidenced by the over-representation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children in out-of-home care. In June 2019, the national rate of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children in out-of-home care was 9.7 times higher than the rate for non-Indigenous children, with 1 in every 16.6 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children in out-of-home care (Hunter et al. 2020). Western Australia was above the national average and the highest in the country at 16.7 times higher. In a recent Western Australian government report over 56% of children and young people in care were Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander (Department of Communities 2020) despite only constituting around 6.4% of the child population (Commissioner for Children and Young People 2020). For Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children in Western Australia, placement with Indigenous carers is also below the national average at 46.9% in 2017-18 (SNAICC 2019a).\nThe tie to family, community, culture, and Country is a key part of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children’s identity and growth and intrinsic to the concept of permanency (SNAICC 2016). This aspect of permanency is formalised in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Child Placement Principle (ATSICPP), which (from SNAICC (2013)) aims to:\n\nRecognise and protect the rights of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children, family members and communities\nIncrease the level of self-determination for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in child welfare matters\nReduce the disproportionate representation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children in the child protection system.\n\nThis Principle has been adopted in jurisdictions around Australia, and, specifically in Western Australia, has been enshrined in law as part of the Child and Community Services Act 2004 (WA 2004). The ATSICPP also appears throughout policy documentation published by the Western Australian Department of Communities (hereafter referred to as ‘the Department’) over the last decade. The Department sees permanency as the most important outcome for children (Department of Communities 2017) and incorporates permanency planning into child protection cases from the beginning. Permanency, however, is defined differently by the Department, with the ATSICPP being one aspect of permanency planning. The difference in the Department’s understanding of permanency is that the critical aspect is the formation of a long-term attachment to a carer, which disregards Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander perspectives and ways of experiencing permanency (SNAICC 2019b).\nOn paper, the Department’s operations are aimed at reducing the over-representation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children in care, with policy directives stating that more Aboriginal Community-Controlled Organisations will be engaged to provide services, Department staff will be trained to provide ‘culturally safe’ services, more services will be funded to support families at risk, provision of support is preferred over removal of a child, and in the case of removal, reunification is worked towards (Department of Communities 2017, 2016a, 2016b). In addition to these positive policies, the Department’s operations have been based on the Signs of Safety framework (Department of Communities 2011) since 2011, a framework which encourages real relationship building between families involved and various professionals, and the consideration of strengths of parents and opportunities for safety, rather than operating in a purely risk-averse way (Turnell & Edwards 1999).\nThe combination of the ATSICPP being embedded in the legal framework and the various policy documents from the last decade would suggest that a reduction would have been achieved. This is unfortunately not the case, with the rate and number of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children in out-of-home care increasing yearly for at least the past decade."

    "section": "Key definitions",
    "text": "Key definitions\nBefore exploring the research on child protection issues in Australia I will first define some key terminology used by the Department and in research more generally.\nMaltreatment of a child is categorised into four broad categories, of which several can be present at the same time:\n\nNeglect - when a child does not receive adequate food or shelter, medical treatment, supervision, care or nurturance to such an extent that their development is damaged or they are injured (Department of Communities 2012a).\nPhysical abuse - when a child is severely and/or persistently hurt or injured by an adult or a child’s caregiver. It may also be the result of putting a child at risk of being injured (Department of Communities 2012b).\nSexual abuse - when a child is exposed to, or involved in, sexual activity that is inappropriate to the child’s age and developmental level (Department of Communities 2012c).\nEmotional abuse - when an adult harms a child’s development by repeatedly treating and speaking to a child in ways that damage the child’s ability to feel and express their feelings (Department of Communities 2012d).\n\nIn the child protection system in Western Australia there are four broad stages:\n\nNotification - where an individual raises concern for a child’s welfare to the Department. These individuals can be anyone, however they tend to be police officers, healthcare workers, and teachers, in part because these groups of professionals are subject to mandatory reporting of sexual abuse (Children and Community Services Amendment (Reporting Sexual Abuse of Children) Act 2008).\nInvestigation - if a notification includes a concern of maltreatment, abandonment, death, or inadequate provision of care, then the department may choose to investigate.\nSubstantiation - after case worker from the Department investigates the report, interviewing relevant parties, they decide whether the concern is substantiated. The three outcomes here are “unsubstantiated”, “substantiated - significant harm (actual)” where actual harm to a child has been substantiated, or “substantiated likelihood of significant harm (has or will occur)” where no harm was substantiated but the investigator believes there is a great risk of harm to the child. This is the stage at which the types of maltreatment are identified.\nConclusion - depending on the evidence in the investigation, the conclusion can result in no action, the provision of support services to address issues of concern, or the removal of a child from their parents.\n\nThe latter two outcomes at the conclusion stage usually lead to a protection order being issued. These protection orders are either temporary (up to two years long) or permanent (until the age of 18). There are four kinds of protection order in the legal framework which governs child protection (WA 2004):\n\nSupervision - this temporary order leaves the child in the care of the parents, but the Department supervises the care of the child. This may include conditions that the parents must meet in order to satisfy the concerns of the Department.\nTime-limited - this temporary order assigns the Department parental responsibility of the child (which usually means removal from the parents).\nUntil 18 - a permanent version of the time-limited order, where the Department is assigned parental responsibility until the child turns 18 or is adopted, or the order is revoked.\nSpecial guardianship - a permanent order where up to two individuals are given parental responsibility for a child until the age of 18. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children must be placed according to the ATSICPP for this order.\n\nThe overall framework of the child protection system is represented in Figure 1.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: An overview of the child protection system in Western Australia"

    "text": "Trends in child protection data\nIn a study of Aboriginal children born in Western Australia in 1990 and 1991 and followed up until their 18th birthday, Bilson et al. (2015) found an estimated 41.8% were reported to child protective services, compared to 11% of non-Aboriginal children. In fact, Aboriginal children were more likely to appear across all stages of the child protection system - they were 3.8 times more likely to be reported, 4.1 times more likely to be investigated, and 5.3 times more likely to have substantiated maltreatment. In the Northern Territory, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children were similarly over-represented in rates of notification (4.6 times) and substantiation (3.7 times) (Guthridge et al. 2012).\nAnother trend in child protection data has been children entering out-of-home care at younger ages and remaining in care for longer periods. The proportion of children in Western Australia entering care for the first time under the age of one rose from 15.3% to 24.8% between 1996 and 2009 (Bilson et al. 2017). In New South Wales, a more recent study of all children who started school in 2009 or 2012 found by age 1, 5.4% had a notification and 0.5% had been placed in out-of-home care, increasing to 13.8% and 1.4% respectively by age 5. These percentages seem small but they still represent over 2,100 children in out-of-home care by the age of five. This trend of increasingly younger entry into out-of-home care is even stronger in South Australia. Segal et al. (2019) estimated the cumulative incidence rates for five different birth cohorts (the earliest of which was births between 1986-91 and the latest was 2010-17), showing an acceleration of the percentage of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children in out-of-home care at younger ages. Spending longer time in out-of-home care is also naturally correlated with earlier entry into out-of-home care as the younger a child is when they enter the system, the more potential years they have to spend in it.\nAn interesting effect of policy change can be observed with the implementation of the Child and Community Services Act 2004 (WA 2004). There was a sharp rise in the number of notifications and investigations by the Department, however the rate of substantiation did not change (Bilson et al. 2017). This is illustrative of how a policy or operational change can have a great impact on the data being recorded but the reality of the situation is not changing. Figure 2 illustrates the changes in the data - note that the 2004 Act was not implemented until 2006, indicated by the change in shading of the bars representing notifications. A later amendment to the Act (Children and Community Services Amendment (Reporting Sexual Abuse of Children) Act 2008) also made it mandatory for certain professionals, e.g. police, teachers, to report concerns of sexual abuse, which also resulted in an increase in the number of notifications for sexual abuse.\n Source: Bilson et al. (2017)"

    "text": "Factors associated with child protection interaction\nThe rate of interactions and removals in the child protection system have been well documented. Several studies have examined which characteristics are related to increasing appearance in the data. Studies on this topic typically rely on administrative data linked with various sources of health information, using the data linkage to estimate the risk associated with particular characteristics. Data linkage can be a powerful way to access large amounts of data on a variety of different topics, however it has some drawbacks. One key issue is identifying Indigenous status. It has been documented that Indigenous people hesitate to identify in healthcare settings, such as hospitals, for fear of mistreatment and discrimination (Christensen et al. 2014). Methods have been developed to improve the quality of Indigenous identifiers, such as comparing the status across multiple different datasets including birth records and family relations. McNamara et al. (2020) demonstrated the use of Indigenous status across family members (i.e. child, parent, and grandparents) to derive a child’s Indigenous status was a more inclusive method than relying on Indigenous status of only the child across datasets. This relies on having multiple datasets available in a linkage, which means studies relying solely on the analysis of hospital records are very likely underestimating the number of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in the data.\nIn the research published on risk factors for entry into the child protection system, the following have consistently been identified to increase the risk of a child having substantiated maltreatment and entering out-of-home care:\n\nMaternal and paternal substance use (O’Donnell et al. 2010, 2015; Jenkins et al. 2018; Orr et al. 2019)\nPoor maternal or paternal mental health (O’Donnell et al. 2010, 2015; Jenkins et al. 2018)\nTeenage mother or father (Orr et al. 2019; O’Donnell et al. 2019)\nMaternal hospital admissions for assault (O’Donnell et al. 2010, 2015; Orr et al. 2019)\nExposure to family domestic violence (Jenkins et al. 2018; Orr et al. 2019)\nLiving in socioeconomically disadvantaged areas (O’Donnell et al. 2010; Orr et al. 2019; Segal et al. 2019)\n\nSeveral congenital conditions have been associated with increased risk of appearing in child protection data. O’Donnell et al. (2010) reported hazard ratios for intellectual disability and cerebral palsy and other birth defects of 1.86 and 1.48 respectively. O’Donnell et al. (2009) also found that Aboriginal mothers were twice as likely to have a child born with neonatal withdrawal syndrome and identified poor maternal mental health and smoking during pregnancy as risk factors for being born with neonatal withdrawal syndrome - the same risk factors for having a child appear in child protection data.\nThese parental characteristics and health issues are only part of the picture though. There are common causes that underlie poor child and maternal health and appearing in child protection data - poverty, intergenerational trauma, systemic racism, lack of support or access to support services, poor housing and homelessness (Hunter et al. 2020)."

    "text": "Health of children\nThe health conditions identified previously have been those associated with increased risk of appearing in child protection data, but what does the overall health of these children going into care look like? This is an important question since carers taking on children need to ensure appropriate healthcare is provided, which means healthcare services need to be available and accessible. This information can also be used to inform early-intervention services to promote good development and wellbeing while children are young - a strategy which has been documented to be more cost effective than treating ill-health and other negative outcomes later in life (Alperstein & Dyer 2012). Providing support early on is not just about preventing ill-health either, good health has influences on every aspect of a child’s life, including education and social activities (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare 2020b).\nGood health begins for a child during pregnancy and the first years of life. The health of the mother during pregnancy impacts birth outcomes, with behaviours like smoking and substance use (factors also associated with child protection involvement) contributing to poor outcomes like low birthweight, which is itself a risk factor for several health conditions in adulthood, such as diabetes (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare 2020b). It has also been found that mothers who experienced family domestic violence (again, another factor for child protection involvement) are twice as likely to give birth to a low birthweight baby (Brown et al. 2015). The provision and uptake of early-intervention support services can help reduce the likelihood of poor prospective health, however this will not change the health needs of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children already in, and at risk of going into, out-of-home care.\nThe Australia’s Children report (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare 2020b) gives an overview of the general burden of disease among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children. Asthma and mental health conditions are the leading causes of disease burden among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children aged 0-14. For Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children under five, the leading chronic health conditions were infant and congenital conditions (such as complications of low birthweight and pre-term birth) while for children aged 5 to 14 the leading causes of health burden were conduct, anxiety, and depressive disorders, asthma, and dental caries. While mental health conditions are common amongst children generally, children in out-of-home care are at even greater risk of experiencing poor mental health (Jones 2017).\nOn a positive note however, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children have high rates of immunisation at age two (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare 2020b). The Australia’s Children report acknowledges that data for children living in out-of-home care is limited, demonstrating that even the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, a government organisation that has access to large and varied datasets, struggles to get information on the health of children in out-of-home care. This further highlights the need to make health information on children in out-of-home care available.\nFew studies have been published on the health of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children in out-of-home care, and the ones that do use highly-localised samples from service providers, limiting their generalisability. In a study of children attending KARI Aboriginal Resources Inc. clinics in south-western Sydney, half of the children had incomplete immunisation schedules (Raman, Reynolds & Khan 2011). This is an important contrast to what is reported in the Australia’s Children report, suggesting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children at risk of entry into out-of-home care may be a subgroup of the larger Indigenous child population, who experience differential rates of health and healthcare. A follow up study consistently found hearing, vision, dental issues in children across several years (prevalences ranging from 30% to 50%), and several developmental deficits in the areas of speech and language and fine motor skills (Raman et al. 2017). Of the health conditions reported in Australia’s Children, asthma, visual impairment, and behavioural problems were common in the children in out-of-home care. Shmerling et al. (2020) conducted a similar analysis of children seen by the Victorian Aboriginal Health service. The same set of respiratory, hearing, visual, and dental issues were found as those in Raman et al. (2017), with prevalences ranging from 30% to 50% in children aged 0 to 13. Mental health and behavioural difficulties as well as delays to speech development were similarly prevalent. As far as I have been able to determine, no similar studies are published on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children in out-of-home care in Western Australia. It is important to capture this information as the geography and climate of Western Australia is very different to Victoria and New South Wales, with a far greater proportion of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people living in remote and very remote locations (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare 2019a) - a characteristic associated with greater experience of poor health (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare 2020b; Department of Health Western Australia 2021)."

    "text": "Potentially preventable hospitalisations\nOne source of administrative data that can provide a glimpse into the health of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children in care is hospital and emergency department data. By linking these data with child protection data we can examine what health conditions children are presenting to hospital with (similar to O’Donnell et al. (2015)). While this methodology is powerful, it does not provide information on primary care visits, so we may be less likely to see health conditions that can be managed in a primary care setting. However, this presents an opportunity to consider the health service utilisation and availability by examining potentially preventable hospitalisations.\nPotentially preventable hospitalisations (PPHs) are “defined as hospital admissions that could have potentially been prevented through the provision of appropriate individualised preventative health interventions and early disease management” (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare 2019b). These hospitalisations can be used as a metric to understand how effective and accessible healthcare services are in a community. If there is a high rate of PPHs in a community it suggests that there is a lack of accessible healthcare services, or those services that are available are not sufficiently addressing the health needs of the community. It should be noted however that PPHs will occur more frequently in areas where there are higher rates of disease, so higher rates do not necessarily imply that the primary care system is less effective.\nPotentially preventable hospitalisations are generally categorised into three groups:\n\nVaccine-preventable conditions - further categorised into ‘Influenza and pneumonia’ and ‘Other vaccine-preventable’. The majority of these admissions tend to be influenza and pneumonia, and Hepatitis C accounts for the majority of admissions in the ‘other’ category (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare 2019b).\nAcute conditions - which are quick onset conditions that may not have needed hospitalisation if adequate and timely primary care was provided.\nChronic conditions - hospitalisation for these conditions may have been avoidable through management in the community or lifestyle changes.\n\nEven though there are many conditions that fall under these different categories it is important to note that hospitalisation for such conditions may not have actually been avoidable.\nOf the few studies published that examine rates of PPHs in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children, they have all found consistently higher rates of admission compared to non-Indigenous children, ranging from:\n\n1.7 in children aged 1 to 4 and 11 in children aged 28 days to 1 year (Stamp, Duckett & Fisher 1998), based on an analysis of NSW/NT/QLD/SA/WA data using admissions per 1,000 population\n4 in children aged 0 to 14 (Li et al. 2009), based on an analysis of admissions per 100,000 population in the NT between 1998 and 2006\n1.7 in children aged 0 to 13, based on an analysis of PPHs per 1,000 person-years observed from 2000 to 2012 in NSW (Falster et al. 2016)\n\nThese findings are consistent with the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (2019b), which reports Indigenous Australians experience PPHs at a rate three times greater than non-Indigenous Australians - a finding that is consistent irrespective of remoteness area (however the rate does increase with increasing remoteness).\nIn a study of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children from the Australian Capital Territory aged 0 to 5, nearly a quarter of PPHs were due to respiratory disease, with injury and infectious disease also in the top 5 (Guthrie 2012). The health categories being found for PPHs is also consistent with nationally published data which finds chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder is the leading cause of PPHs for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and is experienced at a rate 5.4 times greater than that for non-Indigenous people (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare 2020c). The other common conditions causing PPHs reported were diabetes complications, rheumatic heart disease, and in children, ear, nose, and throat infections. These data are predominantly for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people of all ages, using age-standardised rates. Very few studies focus specifically on, or report separately, PPHs in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children. One of the few studies which does, a study in New South Wales, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children were admitted more frequently for every condition, with respiratory and infectious disease conditions among the most common (Falster et al. 2016)."

    "text": "Conclusion\nTo summarise, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children experience similar types of health conditions in their disease burden, but the rate at which it is experienced is disproportionately higher than non-Indigenous children. These children are also over-represented in out-of-home care and the child protection system more generally. There are a variety of factors causing this over-representation, such as poverty, systemic racism, and intergenerational trauma, which ultimately is the result of colonisation and the continuing lack of support for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. Research has examined the health of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children generally, but there is little published on the general health of children who enter out-of-home care. Additionally, a more up-to-date analysis is needed for Western Australian child protection data to examine the recent trends in greater detail."

    "text": "Methods\nThe data that will be used to inform the analyses of my thesis comes from a data linkage performed by the Western Australian Data Linkage Branch. The cohort consists of approximately 33,000 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children born in Western Australia and their siblings, parents, and grandparents. In terms of the data linkage methodology, the central linking unit (i.e. the individual to which the other family members are linked to) are Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children born in Western Australia between 2000 and 2013. Siblings of these children born outside of those years, as well as parents and grandparents, are included in the linkage. There is maternal information for all children, however paternal information is missing for some children. Grandparental information is missing in some cases too, such as where no father is recorded on a birth certificate, or the mother was born interstate so her birth record is not available to link. The full list of data sources in the data linkage, along with the range of years for each data source, are listed below:\n\nChild Protection and Family Support Data (1979-2019)\nMidwives Notification System (1980-2019)\nBirth registrations (1945-2019)\nHospital Morbidity Database Collection (1970-2019)\nEmergency Department Database Collection (2002-2019)\nWA Notifications of Notifiable Infectious Diseases (1964-2019)\nWA Register of Developmental Abnormalities - Birth defects (1980-2019)\nWA Register of Developmental Abnormalities - Cerebral Palsy (1980-2019)\nIntellectual Disability Exploring Answers\nDeath registrations (1969-2019)\nWA Infant, Child, Youth Mortality database\nMental Health Information System (1966-2019)\nMental Health National Outcomes and Casemix Collection\nDrug and Alcohol Office (1985-2005)\n\nDifferent statistical methods and datasets will used to address the research question for each chapter."

The results of my searches include government reports and policy documentation, technical documentation, and research articles and reports. I have synthesised the information presented in these different sources into a narrative review which explores the history and trends in the child protection system, nationally and in Western Australia, as well as the health of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children and families in relation to child protection.\nTasks for this chapter:\n\n\n\n\n\nItem\nDue\nProgress\n\n\n\n\nIdentify search topics\nApr 2020\nComplete\n\n\nPerform literature search\nMay 2020\nComplete\n\n\nRead literature\nDec 2020\nComplete\n\n\nDraft child protection review\nJan 2021\nComplete\n\n\nDraft child health review\nMar 2021\nNear completion\n\n\nFinalise literature review\nMay 2021\nIn progress\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 2 - Methodology\nIn this chapter I will be explaining the data sources and describing the cohort and data linkage methodology. I will be including any pertinent information relating to the data, including issues of data quality and the operational and political history and context of the data. The cohort will be described on a variety of characteristics, including:\n\nNumber of children\nNumber of child years observed in the child protection data\nNumber of siblings (half- and full-), parents (mother and father) and number of grandparents (maternal and paternal)\nAverage and range of duration of follow-up\nAverage and range of number of interactions with the child protection system\nAverage and range of number of admissions in the hospital and emergency data\nRate of missing data and censoring\n\nI will also cover some statistical methodologies I have planned to use in subsequent chapters which involve data analysis and statistical modelling.\nTasks for this chapter:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem\nDue\nProgress\n\n\n\n\nDraft description of the data and data linkage\nJun 2021\nNot started\n\n\nDraft of proposed analysis methods\nJun 2021\nNot started\n\n\nCoding of the cohort\nJuly 2021\nIn progress\n\n\nDescriptives of the cohort\nJuly 2021\nNot started\n\n\nFinalise chapter\nAug 2021\nNot started\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 3 - Descriptive analysis of trends in the child protection system\nAim: Quantify contemporary trends in WA child protection data, examining the rates in different areas of the child protection system such as the different stages (notification through to conclusion) or types of maltreatment.\nThis chapter will be a descriptive analysis, I will not be fitting any statistical models to the data. I will examine the trends in the four stages (notification, investigation, substantiation, placement in out-of-home care) and trends in the different maltreatment categories (neglect, physical abuse, emotional abuse, sexual abuse). The methods used for this chapter will mainly be data visualisation and tabulation. The results will be presented in terms of rates of interactions per 1,000 children, and broken down by key characteristics like age at interaction or child sex.\nI plan to submit this paper for publication by December 2021. The current authorship team includes my four supervisors (Sandra Eades, Alison Gibberd, Bridgette McNamara, Koen Simons) as well as Dan MacAulay (ECU) and Kathleen Falster (UNSW) from the study advisory group.\nTasks for this chapter:\n\n\n\n\n\nItem\nDue\nProgress\n\n\n\n\nOrganise authorship team\nJun 2021\nComplete\n\n\nDraft aims of paper\nJun 2021\nIn progress\n\n\nAnalyse the data\nOct 2021\nNot started\n\n\nWrite up the paper\nNov 2021\nIn progress\n\n\nSubmit the paper\nDec 2021\nNot started\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 4 - Causal pathways to the child protection system\nAim: Use directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to synthesise the literature on child protection and health into a framework which attempts to capture the complexity of the variables involved in both child protection and child health.\nThis chapter does not require the use of any data, the focus is to produce a theoretical framework which can guide my future analyses. I will be drawing heavily on the published research covered in the literature review to build a DAG. By building this framework I also hope to improve understanding of the complex inter-relatedness and causality of the different factors, going beyond simple associations.\nAs I have been reading the literature on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health and child protection issues I have been building a mental map of how I think different variables are related to each other. My current thoughts are captured in Figure 3.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: A theoretical DAG for Indigenous child protection and health\n\n\nTasks for this chapter:\n\n\n\n\n\nItem\nDue\nProgress\n\n\n\n\nDraft aims of the chapter\nDec 2021\nNot started\n\n\nBuild causal framework\nJan 2022\nIn progress\n\n\nWrite up chapter\nFeb 2022\nNot started\n\n\nSeek feedback and make edits\nMar 2022\nNot started\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 5 - Health profile of children going into care\nAim: Describe the general health of children prior to entering out-of-home care, examining common conditions and their trends in time and geography and variation by age.\nIn this chapter I plan to build a general health profile of the children who go into care in an effort to understand the health burden placed on carers.\nThe analysis will be descriptive, drawing on data visualisation and summaries to examine which conditions are appearing in the health data prior to entry into out-of-home care. This chapter will also explore the health service utilisation by comparing potentially preventable hospitalisations before and after being placed in care. One hypothesis is that parents whose children end up in out-of-home care may have poor access to primary healthcare and support services, so conditions which could have been treated or managed by primary care and other support services will be more likely to appear in the hospital and emergency admissions data. Once a child is placed into out-of-home care the carer may have better access to primary care services, so will be less likely to see potentially preventable hospitalisations for the child in the admissions data after placement into out-of-home care.\nTasks for this chapter:\n\n\n\n\n\nItem\nDue\nProgress\n\n\n\n\nOrganise authorship team\nApr 2022\nNot started\n\n\nDraft aims of the paper\nApr 2022\nNot started\n\n\nAnalyse data\nMay 2022\nNot started\n\n\nWrite up paper\nJul 2022\nNot started\n\n\nSubmit paper\nAug 2022\nNot started\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 6 - Exposed vs. unexposed comparison of health outcomes\nAim: Compare the health outcomes and health service utilisation for children depending on their level of interaction with the child protection system.\nUsing a retrospective cohort design I will construct different cohorts to perform these comparisons. The exposed and unexposed groups will be children who are placed in out-of-home care and children who are never placed in out-of-home care, respectively. Depending on the further consultation with the study advisory group and the community and policy reference groups the analysis can be extended to compare children who ever appear in the child protection data (as opposed to only those who go into out-of-home care) with those who never do. Survival analysis methods may be used to estimate hazard ratios for the two cohorts.\nTasks for this chapter:\n\n\n\n\n\nItem\nDue\nProgress\n\n\n\n\nOrganise authorship team\nSep 2022\nNot started\n\n\nDraft aims of the paper\nSep 2022\nNot started\n\n\nAnalyse data\nOct 2022\nNot started\n\n\nWrite up paper\nDec 2022\nNot started\n\n\nSubmit paper\nJan 2023\nNot started"

If you’re a non-R user I hope this blog post convinces you to ditch other word processing software and make the jump to RMarkdown. It’s free!\nThis post was borne out of a tweet about using RMarkdown that seemed to be well received, and someone asked if there was a tutorial. There probably is already, but I figured I would write my own mini-guide on the things I do that make writing so much easier in RMarkdown. This isn’t going to be comprehensive but hopefully it gives you enough of an idea that if you run into trouble you can google your way out of it.\nBefore we get into why writing reports using RMarkdown is a no-brainer I want to preface that I am absolutely not an expert in R or RMarkdown and it’s quite possible there are smarter/cleaner/more efficient ways of doing everything here. What I will show you though is all the things that I think are really swell.\nI write all my documents and knit to PDF, so all my advice is based around this setup. No idea if it works the same if you knit to other formats. Also, there is some degree of assumed knowledge in this post, for example you know what it means to knit a document or what a code chunk is. If you’re unsure about what something means you can google it - this is how I learned most of my knowledge. If you are really stuck you can always send me a tweet. I can’t promise I can help but it’s possible.\nOne final caveat - I’m a Windows user. All this stuff is probably functionally the same on Mac but I couldn’t tell you so you might need to translate my Windows instructions into Mac. If you’re a linux user… Well you probably know how to do all of this anyway, or at the very least you’re a sucker for software punishment so will have no qualms googling your own problems.\nOk, time to get into the good stuff."

Below is a toy example of what a nicely organised project folder might look like:\n2022-02-10-chapter-3\n- code\n    analysis.R\n    cleaning.R\n- data\n  - raw-data\n      original_data.csv\n  clean-data.csv\n- img\n    histogram.pdf\n    survival-curve.pdf\n- meetings\n    2022-02-10.txt\n- tab\n    summary-stats.csv\n    interactions.csv\nchapter-3.Rproj\ncitation.csl\nreferences.bib\nwriteup.Rmd\nwriteup.pdf\nI have separate folders for my code, data, images, meeting notes, and tables. Then in the main directory I have the R project file, my references, and my RMarkdown file with the write up in it. I do often end up with other random files in the folder that I don’t have a home for and that’s fine, but at least most things have a home. This is what works for me, if it doesn’t work for you, you do you.\nI always start each project by making a new folder where I’m planning to keep everything and name it using the convention “yyyy-mm-dd-project-name”. The date being the date on which I created the folder, and doing so means alphanumerically sorting the folders also sorts them chronologically. Nice!\n\n\nWorkflow\nThis section is where the basis for the magic begins. Getting this right is critical to automating the numbers, tables, and figures in your write up.\nI try my best to split my code up into different .R files depending on what I’m doing, with each subsequent file starting off with the data produced at the end of the previous file. This means if you need to edit something during the cleaning phase you can do so, and as long as you haven’t done anything drastic, your changes shouldn’t break anything downstream. The order I tend to follow in my code is:\n\nGetting the data together\n\nFor my thesis I work with multiple linked datasets, each contained in their own .csv file. For an analysis I might need to use information from births data, deaths data, and child protection data. So the first thing I do is get all my data together. This usually just means running a bunch of read_csv() commands to get all the datasets in that I need.\n\nCleaning the data\n\nNext I look through each dataset and make sure it contains what I think it should, doesn’t contain any nonsensical values (e.g. negative ages), and fix any errors that I come across. For me, cleaning the data means only working with the existing variables and values in the dataset, distinct from making new variables which I do in the next section.\n\nPreparing the data\n\nI suppose ‘preparing’ the data is just another type of cleaning, but I like to call them different things because it helps separate out the two processes. By preparing data I mean creating new variables or datasets based on the result of the cleaning stage. This could be performing a bunch of joins, reshaping your data from wide to long, making composite variables. The goal of this section is to end up with the variables and datasets that you need for your analysis.\n\nAnalysing the data\n\nThis is arguably the exciting section, where you get to fit your models, plot your graphs, create your summary tables. Anything that you plan to include in the write up of your analysis should be saved as a distinct file. This means any tables or figures should be saved in the folders you made for them (see @Folder Structure). By doing this you don’t have to re-run the entirety of your code when you come back to work on your write up.\n\nWriting up\n\nIdeally all your analysis is done and all you need to do is write up the results. Assuming each of the previous stages has gone well, the tips in the next few sections should make writing up a little less painful.\n\n\nEasy citations\nHave you been terrorized by EndNote? Is Mendeley telling you the MS Word addin is not installed even though you’ve installed it three times? Has Zotero … well I don’t know anything about Zotero but every software has its bugs. Anyway, ditch the citation management software, we’re doing hipster references now. (Note: you don’t have to ditch your reference management software, see my final comment in this section)\nThe end goal of using RMarkdown (or is it bookdown? I don’t know) for citations is to reduce the burden of keeping track of your in-text references, adding them to the bibliography, and getting the formatting of your references correct. All you need to do is keep your references file up to date.\nSo to start, you need to make a references file. If you currently have all your references in one of the aforementioned software then you will need to export it to a .bib file. Some of them already store references in this file format anyway so it’s no trouble, others you will need to figure out how to export as a .bib. One way or another you need to have a .bib file. Fortunately, if you’re not sure how to export your existing references list google will have the answer.\nIf you’re starting from scratch, open up your project folder, right-click and make a new text file. Edit the name and call it references.bib, making sure to delete the .txt so it’s called references.bib not references.bib.txt. If you can’t delete the .txt extension you might need to change your explorer settings to allow you to do so.\nOk so you have your shiny new references.bib. Now we need to add citations to it. Every journal’s website has some way of exporting citations as a .bib. Some journals make it way too complicated for my liking, but it is possible. When you’re on the page of the article that you want to cite, find the ‘Cite this’ button and click ‘Export as .bib’ or whatever sounds like it’ll give you a .bib file. It could also say ‘export as BibTeX’, since .bib is the file extension for BibTeX files. This is what it looks like on Elsevier’s website:\n\nIf it’s not possible, you can always go to Google Scholar, search for the article, and get the citation that way. I usually do this if I forgot to download the citation at the same time as I downloaded the article or if it’s a report or something from ‘grey literature’. The latter reason makes Google Scholar quite handy as it saves you from having to manually create the citation. Below is what you need to click on in Google Scholar to get a BibTeX citation.\n\nOnce you have your citation the next step is to put it in your references.bib file. All you need to do is copy and paste it from the file you just downloaded (or directly from the browser if you used Google Scholar). I like to use Notepad to open my references file because I’m a reference hipster but you can open it in RStudio too. I should probably do this but Notepad does the job and I like it. You can paste the citation anywhere in your references file as long as it’s not inside of another citation. RMarkdown will let you know if there’s a problem with your references file anyway, so if you make a boo-boo you’ll hear about it. I did try to keep my references file in alphabetical order by first author’s last name, but it got out of hand pretty quickly and now it’s a jumbled mess. Fortunately CTRL + F exists so who cares. Here’s a snippet from my references.bib for my PhD thesis.\n\nNext we have an example of a citation, the very first publication I was an author on.\n@article{eaton2019,\n  title={Incidence of treated first episode psychosis from an Australian early intervention service and its association with neighbourhood characteristics},\n  author={Eaton, Scott and Harrap, Benjamin and Downey, Linglee and Thien, Kristen and Bowtell, Meghan and Bardell-Williams, Melissa and Ratheesh, Aswin and McGorry, Patrick and O'Donoghue, Brian},\n  journal={Schizophrenia Research},\n  volume={209},\n  pages={206--211},\n  year={2019},\n  publisher={Elsevier}\n}\nNote at the beginning of the citation immediately after the opening bracket { it says eaton2019. This string is what you will use when citing that article in the text of your RMarkdown document. Pick a convention for this string and stick to it so you don’t need to keep looking through your reference file to find the name you gave to the citation. My preference is first author’s last name and year of publication. If they have multiple publications in a year I just put a/b/c at the end of each publication to distinguish them as you can’t have two citations with the same name.\nWith your references.bib filled in and ready to go, now you need to make your citations in text. Every citation begins with the @ symbol followed by the string for the article you want to cite. In the above example recall it was eaton2019 so in our RMarkdown text we would type something like @eaton2019 found... or greater incidence of first episode psychosis [@eaton2019]. Note the use of square brackets in the second example.\n@eaton2019 found... becomes “Eaton et al. (2019) found…”\nwhereas\ngreater incidence of first episode psychosis [@eaton2019] becomes “greater incidence of first episode psychosis (Eaton et al. 2019)”\nNow you know how to add citations to your references file, add everything you read in there. It doesn’t matter if it’s full of unused citations, only the ones you cite in text will appear in your references list.\nThere are two final pieces to this puzzle. The first is the citation format. Depending on the requirements of the journal you’re submitting to, or professor you’re writing an assignment for, download the appropriate csl file for the citation format. You can find an enormous list of csl files on Zotero’s website, which is where the bookdown authors suggest you look.\nThe beauty of being able to switch your citation style by changing one line of code brings a tear to my eye. If only I knew about this in my undergraduate degree, I wouldn’t have missed those couple of marks for correct formatting. You do need to tell RMarkdown to use the csl file though, so in the header of your document you need to include the following code\nbibliography: \"references.bib\"\ncsl: \"harvard-the-university-of-melbourne.csl\"\nThe second piece is to tell RMarkdown where you want your reference list to go. Just place the following bit of code where you want your references to go and it’ll get populated when you knit the document.\n&lt;div id=\"refs\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\nThat’s it!\nOne final comment here is that you can stick with your existing reference management software - as long as you’re able to define the citation string (that first bit of text in the BibTeX reference) and export your reference list to a .bib file. If you can’t manually define that string you’ll find the default is something absolutely bonkers you’ll never remember, like S0022283665802716.\nI prefer to manually manage my references because ultimately it doesn’t matter how it’s ordered. I just stick every citation for everything I read into my references.bib file and when it comes to writing up, everything I’ve read is ready to be cited.\n\n\nAutomatic numbering for tables and figures\nPicture this - you’ve finished your first draft and there’s a smattering of tables and figures. For each table and figure you manually wrote out its number based on where it appears in the article and each of them is referred to multiple times throughout the text. Your collaborator gives you feedback that Figure 3 should come earlier in the article, Table 5 is unnecessary, and maybe Figure 4 should go in the appendix. Great! But now you have to go back and change their numbers and make sure your in-text references match these new numbers.\nThis is a horrible job and very much error-prone. We’re human after all. Fortunately bookdown can take care of the numbering for you.\nThe first thing you need to do is set the output in the header to pdf_document2. If you are knitting to a regular pdf the automatic numbering doesn’t work. You should have something like this in the header:\noutput:   \n  bookdown::pdf_document2\nNext, you need to give a name to each code chunk that you want to include in your text. For consistency you could name all the code chunks in your document but I only bother if it’s a table or figure I’m including in the text. In the below example I have a couple of summary tables from my beer spreadsheet. Notice in the code chunks below I have called the two tables rating and prior, which is what we’ll use for our referencing.\n{r rating}\nkable(rating, caption = \"Average cost and rating by style\")\n\n\n\nAverage cost and rating beer by style\n\n\nStyle\nPrice\nRating\n\n\n\n\nBarrel Aged Sour\n11.90\n4\n\n\nFruit Pale Ale\n12.00\n3\n\n\nBlackcurrant Imperial Stout\n16.00\n3\n\n\nGose\n6.74\n2\n\n\nTripel\n30.00\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n{r prior}\nkable(prior, caption = \"Average rating by number of beers consumed prior\")\n\n\n\nAverage rating by number of beers consumed prior\n\n\nBeers\nRating\n\n\n\n\n0\n2.6\n\n\n1\n2.7\n\n\n2\n2.5\n\n\n3\n2.5\n\n\n4+\n2.4\n\n\n\n\n\nHopefully you noticed these tables were already assigned numbers - the rating by style is Table 1 and the rating by number of beers prior is Table 2. I didn’t assign these numbers, they were automatically assigned for me. So how do we automate the in-text numbers? You simply use the code @\\ref(tab:&lt;your chunk name here&gt;), replacing the angle brackets with the name of your chunk that has the table in it. So if I were to reference the two tables above I’d use Table @\\ref(tab:rating) and Table @\\ref(tab:prior). Note that you still need to write out ‘Table’ beforehand, the reference only grabs the number.\nThe above method for tables is basically the same for figures too, you instead use @\\ref(fig:&lt;your chunk name here&gt;) - note ‘fig’ has replaced ‘tab’ in the round brackets.\nOne nuance I found is that the name of your code chunk is important. For example I called a chunk interactions_all and the auto-numbering did not work, it instead spat out @\\ref(fig:interactions_all) in the text. I renamed the chunk to all and updated the reference accordingly and it worked fine. Maybe it was an issue with the length of the name, maybe it was the underscore. I’m sure if I read the bookdown manual I’d understand why but who has time to read the manual, right!?\n\n\nAutomatic in-text numbers\nTyping in the numbers from your analysis is error prone - we’ve already established that we’re all human. Also, it’s a massive pain in the ass if you need to update everything because of changes to your code. Maybe your cohort is smaller now so all of your descriptive statistics changed, but instead of putting them in a table (like the previous section), you typed them into the body of your article. Well, RMarkdown allows you to do in-text R code too, as we’ll demonstrate.\nstats &lt;- beer %&gt;% \n  summarise(litres = round(sum(Ml)/1000),\n            minabv = min(Abv),\n            maxabv = max(Abv))\nIn the code above we made a few summary statistics and saved them in a dataframe called stats. If we want to insert them into the text, we just need to write some inline R code. For example, over the course of my beer recording adventures I consumed 131 litres of beer, with the least alcoholic beer coming in at 0.4% and the most alcoholic at 13%. The inline code I included for these three statistics were\n` r stats$litres`\n` r stats$minabv`\n` r stats$maxabv`\nFor the latter two, I included the percentage symbol immediately after the closing backtick to have it attached to the number. Also, in the three examples note the space between the first backtick and the ‘r’. This shouldn’t be there - I just had to include the space otherwise the code gets evaluated and you would see the numbers instead of the code."

    "text": "Minor gripes\nOk so BIIIIIIIIIG preface here that it’s highly likely that the stuff in this section is actually doable in R, it’s just these annoyances are so minor that I don’t mind my current way of overcoming them. For example, I use MS Word to get a word count but I just googled to see if you can get a word count in R and it turns out there’s a package called wordcountaddin. Not sure if I’ll use this package but it illustrates my point. I can’t think of a time I’ve not been able to find a package that does the thing that I need.\n\nSpell checking\nThe spell check function in RStudio is handy for picking up some spelling errors (duh) but there’s no checking for grammar, so my current method of doing a grammar check is to open the knitted PDF using MS Word. Just open up Word, click File -&gt; Open, then open the PDF and Word will do its best to translate the file into a Word document. Usually this works fine and often picks up an issue here or there that needs fixing. Note this isn’t a substitution for actual proof-reading - still do this! Apologies to non-Word users, not sure how you would do it without Word but I’m sure there’s a way.\n\n\nWord count\nWhen I’ve got the document open in Word I also do the word count. Criteria for word counts vary from journal to journal, with some including tables, some excluding, references do or don’t count. Anyway, I just delete all the non-contributing content and get my word count that way. Not the most efficient approach but it’s not painful and it works.\n\n\nFiguring stuff out is hard\nSometimes things break, or I can’t get them the way I want them to work, and it takes me ages to figure stuff out. Initially I would cringe at the thought of it taking me days to figure out how to make a table using R, when I could just make it in two minutes in MS Word. However I have spend countless hours over the past few years updating the same table over and over again due to changes in the data. Taking two days to learn how to make those tables in R would have saved me many more days of work in the long run. Having drunk the kool-aid I am now delighted that it took me three hours to figure out how to add an extra row to a table header.\nThe point I want to make is that if you are reading this blog post and trying to follow along and things don’t make sense or don’t work, don’t worry. You’ll figure it out eventually, this is just the process of learning something that is actually quite challenging to pick up."

To do this I started off making a new ‘Quarto Blog’ project in RStudio following the documentation on Quarto’s website. It’s important to select blog, not website at this step.\nThe very first thing you want to do is swap the YAML between the about.qmd and index.qmd files. This is because the index is the home page for your website. Quarto’s default is to make the blog your home page, but we don’t want that. Swapping the YAML puts your bio as the home page. I also renamed the posts folder to post, just in case that mattered but I’m not sure it does.\nThe next thing is to rename about.qmd, calling it post.qmd. This is now your main page for your blog and it has the same URL structure as the old Hugo Academic template. This means when you migrate your blog posts from your old to your new website, the URLs won’t break. Yay!"

    "text": "Employment\n\nBiostatistician, Data Manager\n\nYardhura Walani, Australian National University\nOctober 2024 - Present\n\nMy time is spent mostly on the Mayi Kuwayu Study, The National Study of Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Wellbeing. The first thing I did was take the lead on finishing the study’s operational manual. In doing this, I converted the existing Word draft into a HTML document using Quarto, making the manual more user-friendly, improving the interface, and making the maintenance of documentation easier.\nI’m also working on building a data management pipeline in R, using targets to manage the structure and evaluation of the pipeline, pointblank and testthat for unit testing and data validation, renv to manage package dependencies across user systems, and having the different stages of data cleaning and management feed into a user manual, data dictionary, and survey data quality report, all using R and Quarto to automate the majority of their generation.\n\n\nQuantitative Social Scientist\n\nCentre for Indigenous Policy Research, Australian National University\nOctober 2023 - October 2024\n\nIn my short time at CIPR I worked on two major reports. For the first, I examined social and emotional wellbeing for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children and youth in the Longitudinal Study of Indigenous Children (LSIC). This was done by starting with an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander theory of social and emotional wellbeing and using exploratory factor analysis and structural equation modelling to map data items in LSIC to different domains of social and emotional wellbeing.\nThe second was a technical report commissioned by the Productivity Commission and Coalition of Peaks, where my co-authors and I proposed a more statistically rigorous method for measuring progress toward Closing the Gap targets. The report covered improvements in measuring progress, recommendations for increasing the quality, frequency, and relevance of data collected for these measures, and guidelines on how to communicate probabilistic statements from statistical models in easy to understand ways.\n\n\nPhD Candidate\n\nIndigenous Health and Epidemiology Group, University of Melbourne\nMarch 2020 - June 2024\n\nThroughout my PhD I translated findings from Aboriginal-led qualitative research and community reference group conversations into questions I could address using linked administrative datasets. This included how child protection is clustered within sibling groups, the prevalence and cumulative incidence of mental and neurodevelopmental health conditions. I used a variety of statistical methods, including survival analysis, matching methods for causal inference, and descriptive statistics and data visualisation. All of my research was written in R and RMarkdown, where I created a reproducible pipeline from data cleaning through to multiple journal articles and my final thesis.\n\n\nBiostatistician\n\nDeakin University - August 2022 - October 2023\nGrampians Health - September 2021 - October 2023\n\nIn these two biostatistician roles I acted as the sole statistical expert in clinical research and academic settings. Across these roles I provided study design and statistical oversight for a randomised trials, including sample size calculations, developing a statistical analysis plans and randomisation schemes, advising on technical challenges arising, and analysing trial data. I also developed educational materials and delivered seminars for clinicians on the topic of good research practices.\n\n\nResearch assistant\n\nPeter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, University of Melbourne\nSeptember 2019 - January 2023\n\nAs part of the International and Immigrant Health Group I provided statistical support to the research team. Major achievements included the development of a REDCap database and provision of on-site research training for local staff for an evaluation of a dietary and lifestyle intervention in a remote Aboriginal community in the Northern Territory, and a systematic review of type 2 diabetes in resettled refugee and asylum seeker populations.\n\nCentre for Health Policy, University of Melbourne\nApril 2018 - January 2022\n\nI supported Emeritus Professor Lesleyanne Hawthorne in the examination of skilled migration to Australia. My work revolved around sourcing data, understanding its complexities, and summarising it to capture quantitative trends in skilled migration to Australia. ABS data products, including the census, were used, as well as administrative data from the Department of Home Affairs, the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency, and the Occupational English Test. We also collaborated with Canadian colleagues to produce a comparison between Australia and Canada’s migration programmes.\n\nMelbourne Institute, University of Melbourne\nMay 2019 - February 2020\n\nIn this short-term role I prepared the final wave of the Medicine in Australia: Balancing Employment and Life survey for release. This involved data cleaning, consistency checking, and updating the user manual to reflect changes to the survey, a process which was technical and required great attention to detail. I also worked as a data custodian, managing the secure transfer of data for research purposes. This role was challenging as I inherited a great deal of code with minimal documentation, however I spent the time to understand how it worked, added the necessary updates, and wrote my own documentation for future reference.\n\n\nBiostatistician\n\nMelbourne EpiCentre, Royal Melbourne Hospital\nNovember 2017 - May 2019\n\nI worked as a statistical consultant providing support to clinicians engaged in medical research. The consulting process began with meetings to identify the clinicians’ specific research questions and how they could be answered with data and statistical techniques, and concluded with the analysis and writing up of results suitable for publication. During my time here I also set up a REDCap database for the IMPETUS-D multi-centre randomised clinical trial and managed the integration of existing administrative data into the database."

The first thing I did was take the lead on finishing the study’s operational manual. In doing this, I converted the existing Word draft into a HTML document using Quarto, making the manual more user-friendly, improving the interface, and making the maintenance of documentation easier.\nI’m also working on building a data management pipeline in R, using targets to manage the structure and evaluation of the pipeline, pointblank and testthat for unit testing and data validation, renv to manage package dependencies across user systems, and having the different stages of data cleaning and management feed into a user manual, data dictionary, and survey data quality report, all using R and Quarto to automate the majority of their generation.\n\n\nQuantitative Social Scientist, Research Fellow\n\nCentre for Indigenous Policy Research, Australian National University\n\nOctober 2023 – October 2024\n\n\nIn my short time at CIPR I worked on two major reports. For the first, I examined social and emotional wellbeing for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children and youth in the Longitudinal Study of Indigenous Children (LSIC). This was done by starting with an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander theory of social and emotional wellbeing and using exploratory factor analysis and structural equation modelling to map data items in LSIC to different domains of social and emotional wellbeing.\nThe second was a technical report commissioned by the Productivity Commission and Coalition of Peaks, where my co-authors and I proposed a more statistically rigorous method for measuring progress toward Closing the Gap targets. The report covered improvements in measuring progress, recommendations for increasing the quality, frequency, and relevance of data collected for these measures, and guidelines on how to communicate probabilistic statements from statistical models in easy to understand ways.\n\n\nPhD Candidate\n\nIndigenous Health and Epidemiology Group, University of Melbourne\n\nMarch 2020 – June 2024\n\n\nThroughout my PhD I translated findings from Aboriginal-led qualitative research and community reference group conversations into questions I could address using linked administrative datasets. This included how child protection is clustered within sibling groups, the prevalence and cumulative incidence of mental and neurodevelopmental health conditions. I used a variety of statistical methods, including survival analysis, matching methods for causal inference, and descriptive statistics and data visualisation. All of my research was written in R and RMarkdown, where I created a reproducible pipeline from data cleaning through to multiple journal articles and my final thesis.\n\n\nBiostatistician\n\nDeakin University\n\nAugust 2022 – October 2023\n\nGrampians Health\n\nSeptember 2021 – October 2023\n\n\nIn these two biostatistician roles I acted as the sole statistical expert in clinical research and academic settings.
