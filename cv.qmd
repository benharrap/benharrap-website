## Employment

### Biostatistician, Data Manager, Research Fellow

-   Yardhura Walani, Australian National University
    -   October 2024 – Present

My time is spent mostly on the Mayi Kuwayu Study, The National Study of Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Wellbeing. The first thing I did was take the lead on finishing the study's operational manual. In doing this, I converted the existing Word draft into a HTML document using Quarto, making the manual more user-friendly, improving the interface, and making the maintenance of documentation easier.

I'm also working on building a data cleaning and management pipeline in R, using `targets` to manage the structure and evaluation of the pipeline, `renv` to manage package dependencies across user systems, integrating external data sources via various APIs, and having the different stages of data cleaning and management feed into a user manual, data dictionary, and survey data quality report, all using R and Quarto to automate the majority of their generation.

### Quantitative Social Scientist, Research Fellow

-   Centre for Indigenous Policy Research, Australian National University
    -   October 2023 – October 2024

In my short time at CIPR I worked on two major reports. For the first, I examined social and emotional wellbeing for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children and youth in the Longitudinal Study of Indigenous Children (LSIC). This was done by starting with an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander theory of social and emotional wellbeing and using exploratory factor analysis and structural equation modelling to map data items in LSIC to different domains of social and emotional wellbeing.

The second was a technical report commissioned by the Productivity Commission and Coalition of Peaks, where my co-authors and I proposed a more statistically rigorous method for measuring progress toward Closing the Gap targets. The report covered improvements in measuring progress, recommendations for increasing the quality, frequency, and relevance of data collected for these measures, and guidelines on how to communicate probabilistic statements from statistical models in easy to understand ways.

### PhD Candidate

-   Indigenous Health and Epidemiology Group, University of Melbourne
    -   March 2020 – June 2024

Throughout my PhD I translated findings from Aboriginal-led qualitative research and community reference group conversations into questions I could address using linked administrative datasets. This included how contacts by child protective services are clustered within sibling groups, the prevalence and cumulative incidence of mental and neurodevelopmental health conditions, and estimating the effect of placement in out-of-home care on rates of potentially preventable hospitalisations. 

I used a variety of statistical methods, including descriptive statistics, various regression models, survival analysis, and matching methods. All of my research was written in R and RMarkdown, where I created a reproducible pipeline from data cleaning through to multiple journal articles and my final thesis.

### Biostatistician

-   Deakin University
    -   August 2022 – October 2023
-   Grampians Health
    - September 2021 – October 2023

In these two biostatistician roles I acted as the sole statistical expert in clinical research and academic settings. Across these roles I provided study design and statistical oversight for a randomised trials, including sample size calculations, developing statistical analysis plans and randomisation schemes, advising on technical challenges arising, and analysing trial data. I also developed educational materials and delivered seminars for clinicians on the topic of good research practices.

### Research assistant

-   Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, University of Melbourne
    -   September 2019 – January 2023

As part of the International and Immigrant Health Group I provided data and statistical support to the research team. Major achievements included the development of a REDCap database and provision of on-site research training for local staff for an evaluation of a dietary and lifestyle intervention in a remote Aboriginal community in the Northern Territory, and a systematic review of type 2 diabetes in resettled refugee and asylum seeker populations.

-   Centre for Health Policy, University of Melbourne
    -   April 2018 – January 2022

I supported Emeritus Professor Lesleyanne Hawthorne in the examination of skilled migration to Australia. My work revolved around sourcing data, understanding its complexities, and summarising it to capture quantitative trends in skilled migration to Australia. ABS data products, including the census, were used, as well as administrative data from the Department of Home Affairs, the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency, and the Occupational English Test. We also collaborated with Canadian colleagues to produce a comparison between Australia and Canada's migration programmes.

-   Melbourne Institute, University of Melbourne
    -   May 2019 – February 2020

In this short-term role I prepared the final wave of the Medicine in Australia: Balancing Employment and Life survey for release. This involved data cleaning, consistency checking, and updating the user manual to reflect changes to the survey, a process which was technical and required great attention to detail. I was also the data custodian, managing the secure transfer of data for research purposes. This role was challenging as I inherited a great deal of code with minimal documentation, however I spent the time to understand how it worked, added the necessary updates, and wrote my own documentation for future reference.

<!-- ### Biostatistician -->

<!-- -   Melbourne EpiCentre, Royal Melbourne Hospital -->
<!--     -   November 2017 – May 2019 -->

<!-- I worked as a statistical consultant providing support to clinicians engaged in medical research. The consulting process began with meetings to identify the clinicians' specific research questions and how they could be answered with data and statistical techniques, and concluded with the analysis and writing up of results suitable for publication. I also set up a REDCap database for the IMPETUS-D multi-centre randomised clinical trial and managed the integration of existing administrative data into the database. -->

## Volunteering

### Wearer of many hats

-   Statistical Society of Australia
    -   December 2018 – Present

Since joining the SSA back in 2018 I have taken on many different voluntary roles, including:

-   Secretary and then President of the Victorian and Tasmanian Branch
-   Coordinator of the 2021 Early Career and Student Statisticians Conference
-   Committee member and Secretary of the Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI) committee
-   Committee member of the Reconciliation Action Plan committee
-   Mentor in the SSA's Mentoring Program

Across these roles I coordinated strategic planning, managed teams, maintained relationships with external organisations, surveyed and reported on EDI in the Australian statistics profession, and wrote EDI recommendations for the Society.
